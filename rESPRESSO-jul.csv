I wanted to share my experience with the Lelit MaraX, which I used as my main machine from 2021 to 2025. Before that, I had a modded Gaggia Classic from 2018 to 2021 ‚Äî equipped with a PID and a spring mod for 9-bar pressure.

When I switched to the MaraX, I expected a clear upgrade in terms of espresso quality. Over time, I even invested in things like the Weber Unibasket and which didn‚Äôt exist back when I had the Gaggia. Despite all that, I could never quite dial in the flavor I wanted on the MaraX. The shots often tasted slightly off ‚Äî missing punch I was used to with the Gaggia Classic. I experimented with different brew temperatures, flushing routines, and both brew modes. I even had the pump replaced in 2024 and fully serviced, but nothing really transformed the experience. Looking back, I‚Äôd honestly say the MaraX gave me worse-tasting shots than the Gaggia, which surprised me.

That said, it wasn‚Äôt all bad. In terms of workflow and usability, the MaraX is fantastic. It‚Äôs much easier to use than the Gaggia Classic, and the ability to steam and brew at the same time is a real plus. Steam pressure is stronger than the GC, recovery is quick, and the E61 design gives it a classic look that fits beautifully on a coffee bar. For milk drinks or daily use, it‚Äôs a very forgiving and beginner-friendly machine with a shorter learning curve than the Gaggia Classic. 

I'm curious, do other people experience similar experience with the MaraX that both had a fully modded Gaggia Classic and MaraX?"

I used to own a Gaggia Cubika Plus which I never got decent espresso from, almost certainly because I had no idea what I was doing. I‚Äôm currently using a Bialetti Brikka moka pot with Dualit grinder that I use local medium roast small batch beans with, and the steam wand on my wife‚Äôs Sage Creatista Nespresso machine for mostly lattes and flat whites, though I do generally enjoy the odd espresso when not at home.

The reality is I‚Äôm forever chasing the nearest thing to true espresso, so it makes sense for me to reassess my view of home espresso machines and get set up properly. I‚Äôve done a TON of research on machines, dialing in the grind, weight, times, etc and feel I‚Äôve a much better understanding now. I‚Äôll probably never be the type of person to obsess and do all the RDT type stuff, but I do want at least a cafe quality espresso to take to work with me on a morning.

I imagine my flow to be -

* Hopper grinder straight into cup on scale
* Dump it in portafilter
* Quick WDT and tamp
* Shot (measured by machine presets)
* Manually steam milk

I‚Äôve looked into both the GCP E24 and the Bambino Plus, and think I‚Äôve decided that the Bambino is a more suitable product for my wife to share. She‚Äôs not fussy and just wants a latte as automatically and in as little time as possible, so presenting her with the required learning curve of the Gaggia probably won‚Äôt be a hit, whereas the Bambino I think she could get on board with (even if it‚Äôs just grinding totally unmeasured into the portafilter, tamping, pouring and using the auto-frother).

The Baratza looks well regarded in its price range so I‚Äòve sort of narrowed it down to that, keeping my total spend around the ¬£500 mark. Spending ¬£400 on a Eureka Mignon seems overkill for our needs, especially with such an entry level espresso machine.

So my question is, can this duo pull (minimum) cafe quality shots and a provide a decent microfoam for latte art? Should I be looking at any other grinders instead? Any advice gratefully received."

I am super interested in the Lelit Anita but I'm wondering if the Breville Barista is a better deal for me. I like them both because both have built in grinder (I'm not too crazy about having a better second grinder as a beginner or achieving the best most amazing shot) and the steam wand seems to be good for both as well in my research.

My concerns are:

1. Porta filter sizes. If I were to try different sizes will it be difficult to acquire them give that Lelit Anita uses 57mm.
2. Repairs - would Breville be a better option for me because it is more readily available in the U.S. and therefore easier/ cheaper to fix.

thank you!

It also clogs way too early, when my grinder is like on step 6.

I was thinking about selling my Dedica and getting something that can better utilize my grinder's potential. The thing is, in my country, DeLonghi is the only European/Western brand available. Others are mostly brands that are either Chinese or made in the ME. Still, there are good and well-regarded brands among these, and although you may not be familiar with them outside here, they still kick ass and some people in my country even prefer them to DeLonghi. They also provide more bang for buck than brands like DeLonghi, since there's less import fees for them here.

So the thing is, is it worth it to sell my Dedica and get a more powerful machine, twice as much the price of the Dedica? Or should I just be happy with it and stop worrying about power?"

Have had the Breville 5 years and it‚Äôs like a trusty Honda accord - might not be fancy but starts and drives with predictably. Generally, I‚Äôve pulled shots with almost no issues and never had more than occasional spraying. I‚Äôve been delighted. But recently, I started getting a lot of spray even after changing the head gasket. It also seemed like the water temperature was a bit lower, and when I tried to increase the temperature using the program buttons, I was unable to increase it by the +2 or +4.  Steam also seemed to have a little less heat and power. Temperature of water streaming from group head is about 160. Is this too low and could decreased temperature be cause of spraying?

Hoping to limp this old friend along until Argus shows up and want to recondition it for a gift to younger couple in first home."

I bought a new filter basket to replace my existing one (which has some micro scratches on it that leads to some minor channeling) and the new basket seems to incorrectly diffuse water both under pressure and not. While normally, with the old basket, the espresso under pressure would pull to a single stream (as expected) when pulling a shot, the new basket, regardless of grind size, will drip/pull espresso through multiple spots across the entire filter basket.*

As a test, to see if it was just my inability to dial the new basket, I added water to each basket and watched how it diffused without pressure to see the tendency of how the water will run through the basket. The begining of the video is the new filter basket where it can be seen that the water unevenly diffuses through the basket resulting in multiple streams with some dripping and others running through. The second part of the video is of the old basket where, to me, it appears that the diffusion is even as it creates a single stream of water, even when not held perfectly level.

Any thoughts on this? Should I return the new basket and have another sent, or is it just due to it needing to have a handful of shots run through it? 

As a note, I do not remember having this issue when I bought the old basket, but that was awhile ago.


Thanks!


*I did not change beans or dose weight between the two baskets. With the new basket, I have run around 5 shots, starting with the same grind size as with the old basket, and then ran shots, changing one grind size at a time (i.e one click), going 2 grind sizes coarser than the start point and 2 grind sizes finer. The grinder is a K2 grinder.

I bought it mostly so I can make pourovers but figured it could be an upgrade to my espresso too. 

Just pulled my first shot, and HOLY SHIT what a HUGE DIFFERENCE it made. I‚Äôve used the same beans from the same roaster for years, and this is the first time the sharp bitterness was gone, the chocolate notes really came out. It tasted like hot chocolate with a little bit of coffee. Honestly I had no idea a grinder would make this much of a difference in taste. Can‚Äôt wait to try other beans.

After doing some research and looking at different brands.  Cycling through Pro/Con videos and of course peoples feedback on this sub-reddit.....  
I selected the Eureka Mignon zero 65 and the Bambino Plus.  

I initially was keen on the Turin DF64.  I did shy away from that because of a few posts regarding the noise.  The pro's kept coming back as such a great grinder.  However, I read on a Veterans post about it, that he had to return his because the frequency that it ground beans at, did wonders to his tinnitus.    
Myself, being a vet, and suffering from tinnitus, I didn't want to take the chance.  

Now, I did want JUST an espresso grinder, but after some reading, several people said they got better espresso grind than other types of grinds.  Since this is going to be mainly for espresso, I'll take that his on lesser grind quality for the rest. 

I purchased everything from Whole Latte Love.  Their staff seemed knowledgeable and threw multiple options at me, never pushing the sale, but letting me make the choice.  

  
I have a pantry to build now while this ships to me, a coffee nook and ikea cabinets to install.  

I'm going to pound some tylenol and get to work lol.  "

62,2025-07-01,Some basic things to remember,u/DaveWpgC,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lpa420/some_basic_things_to_remember/,"- when you ask for opinions about equipment typically people will tell you to buy what they own. It's rarely advice about comparable merits of different brands/models
- if you own a Synchronika 2 and tell me that I wasted money on my Slayer be prepared for the Profitec Pro 500 to say the same thing to you. And that person should hear the same from the Rancilio Sylvia owner, who should catch shit from the Flair 58 Pro. This sub tends to attract a lot of gear lovers. We buy better and better equipment because we want to.
- 36 grams espresso from 18 grams coffee in 30 seconds is a starting point. From there start adjusting time and weight based on what tastes good to you.
- a quality grinder, good fresh beans and proper water parameters will have more impact on the taste in your cup than the machine that produces the shot.
- keep a log of beans, weight used and grind level and use that to guess at starting point for new beans. As the beans age and you grind finer, record that If you buy the same beans again go to your log and choose the grind level based on your previous purchase.
- don't spend money you don't have on espresso equipment. Debt doesn't make sense for these purchases.
- If your shot goes way too fast, sprays all over and your grinder is set at its finest, your grinder is probably not capable of making an espresso shot. It could be puck prep but probably not.
- if you can't tell the difference between sour and bitter, Google salami shot and do that process. The first cups you taste represent sour, the last bitter.
- this is all supposed to be fun and relaxing. Don't sweat the mistakes, learn from them and move on "

I enjoy the preparation of espresso coffee and feel now is the time for me to upgrade my setup.

I am looking to purchase a good quality grinder to see what difference that makes to my shots with the Express first. I will probably upgrade my machine then in the next few months.

Based in Ireland and I'm open to all suggestions.

To replace it, I went with a Gaggia Classic Pro. This turned out to be a really TERRIBLE choice. Makes perfectly fine coffee, but five of the little red lenses that tell you if it's on, ready to brew and ready to steam broke. The seller (Whole Latte Love) was very nice and sent me replacements for free, but I've had to open it up three times in less than four months. 

They contacted Gaggia who were breezy and dismissive and said ""guess you better stock up on those lenses!"" and offered no explanation as to why this would happen (the machine never moves, and all I do is make two coffees a day). The seller has agreed to take the machine back and refund my money, which is generous of them. It's not THEIR fault that this thing is poorly made.

So now I'm left with the choice of what to buy next. Obviously Gaggia is off the list, since they did not care at all that their little plastic bits were cheap and crummy and kept breaking. I don't need a grinder as I bought a new one of those (from Breville with a discount they offered me when my old machine broke and couldn't be repaired).

Breville is an obvious choice. I have one of their microwaves too. Their stuff is well made and supported. But it's also made in China which I'd prefer to avoid if I can.

Any advice would be nice. Thanks."

I mainly use instant coffee because I'm able to have so much more customization with it ( adjust amount of water I want, can have whenever, wherever fast, can have hot, cold. Etc.) and I've used two brands throughout my journey: cafe bustelo espresso and Maxwell house, both there instant coffee versions. 

Maxwell has been the one I like the most as when I drink it I feel way more energized physically and mentally, however sometimes I will have cafe bustelo to switch it up a bit and I notice upon drinking it my head feels clearer but I feel really tired and groggy like I want to take a nap. 

I have done research and done the same caffeine amount for each, I made sure all other variables were in check. (Rest, hydration, low stress) and it seems that only cafe bustelo espresso makes me feel this way. I also notice other espresso drinks I get at restaurants, coffee shops make me feel this way to compared to just normal black coffee.

I'm sure I have adhd as I've always had symptoms of it ever since I was little, but this seems really specific as I can drink the same amount of coffee (caffeine wise) in each and have two completely different affects. Just curious into why this might be.

I also really like espressos, so it actually makes me kind've annoyed that it does this.

Most companies solve this by selling an upgraded short hopper, but they don't. 

I tried to search on Etsy for solutions but because this is a 64 versus 65 mm grinder, the hopper connector is slightly smaller than most. I'm thinking of either returning the grinder or figuring out a way to cut the polycarbonate. Does anyone have any thoughts on what I could do?

Brand new to espresso here and I just made my first espresso this morning and it was absolutely horrible. Very bitter and dark. I know there's a lot of possible issues but maybe you can look at my equipment and let me know what's happening.

So I made a default cup just using the stuff that came with the machine a week ago. It was actually pretty decent. Not good but ok.

So to upgrade I got some equipment. I got a K6 grinder, [this bottomless porta filter ](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Mellow-DeLonghi-Porta-Filter-Bottomless/dp/B08KLG3MK6), and a distributor and tamper that are coming in today. 

First issue, I measured out 14.5 grams of coffee, ground it at the k6 recommended setting of 40 clicks, and it way overfilled my filter. So it just put a little in. Then I measured out my shot at 1:2 and it came out in a second or two.

I Know supposedly too fast means not enough pressure which means not fine enough. I tried 10 clicks, and did just 7 grams of coffee and it hit 14 grams of water again in like a second or two.

My basic question, aside from any advice you have is this. Is my K6 just not going small enough? Will my tamper help me get a better flow so much greater that it'll change this? Just a few seconds to hit that much water seems way too fast to me.

Worth noting I think these beans might be bad. Bought from Kaldi (a chain coffee/foreign food shop in Japan). They're super dark and brittle. They fall apart in my hands sometimes when I pick them up if I'm not careful.

Would you guys say that these machines tend to be above or below the expectations of a keurig machine? And if these machines are truly that bad, would a moka pot suffice?

Thanks!"

However I also saw an ECM Synchronika for high 2k. 

Both are 6 years old. ECM owner said he‚Äôs done 3500 coffees since 2019 and the machine has been sitting in the garage for the past 2 years but have it serviced every year (he can provide receipt). 

Both seller looks legit - and yes, I‚Äôll be sure to avoid scammers since it‚Äôs been going around. 

The question remains‚Ä¶ the ECM has all the features I wanted in Bianca. I just don‚Äôt know if getting a secondhand is a good idea or wait next year good friday and hope for a good sale? I do have it in mind even with sales I think ECM still out of budget by 1.5-2k easy üòÖüòÖ

I might be able to negotiate the ECM to mid 2k. But if not, is it still worth the older machine while newer machine altho not as superb then have newer up to date features such as fast heating time/programmable schedule etc?

So I have gathered a message from this subreddit that the best budget options for espresso making is an areopress and a moka pot. I could probably get an areopress and it would be easy to use and all that, but I feel the moka pot would be cheaper in the long run since I wouldn't have to repurchase micro filters for the areopress, so I'm thinking of buying a moka pot, but there's an issue. I don't have a gas burner stove type, and whenever I've seen moka pots being used they were using the gas stoves and not an electric induction stove like the one in my house. However a while ago I was looking for videos to demonstrate how a moka pot was used, and I saw a specific method that allowed you to use an inductionstove instead. I don't remember all the details, but what happened was that the grounds were properly inserted into the moka pot before having boiling water filling the pot, which was then placed on an induction stove on medium heat. Watching the video, I saw that it works but I wanted to get another answer that this actually works, before I potentially waste my money on a moka pot. Also also, does the brand of moka pot matter? Will the generic brand moka pot from a shelf in the max do just as good as a job as a branded moka pot? Added the no budget indicator even though it's redundant with areopresses and moka pots cause my post would get removed otherwise "

\*- a metal tamp (for the Stilosa/ECP 51mm or 51.3mm)   
\*- a WDT (Weiss distribution technique) tool - helps with the puck preparation, decreases clumps, and channeling  
\*- a fine sprayer bottle for RDT (Ross droplet technique) - removes static electricity during grinding, helps decrease coffee retention in the grinder - don't do it if your manual mentions not to do it  
\*- a small digital scale, preferably with a timer (which fits on the drain tray of the machine)  
\- a puck bucket/knock box  
\- a microfiber cloth (for cleaning the steam wand)  
\*- a zip tie to hold the rubber nozzle of the steam wand when you remove the metal tube ""Panarello"" (or whatever it's called), which is one of the better hacks for such a DeLonghi machine  
\- a smaller and a bigger milk pitcher with a pointed tip, for steaming the milk, and doing latte art  
\- a tamping mat (to protect your surface)  
\- a manual grinder like the KinGrinder P1, P2, K4, or K6 (to use till you get a stronger grinder and to have as a backup + for pour-over, French press, and some healthy manual exercise) - such manual grinders grind better and have more adjustment steps than most sub-200‚Ç¨ electric grinders. Burr grinders are way better than blade grinders.  
\- a dosing funnel which fits your portafilter (51mm for DeLonghi Stilosa, Dedica), to make less mess  
\*- a single cup and a double cup UNPRESSURIZED basket (51mm for DeLonghi ECP, Stilosa, etc)  
\- a bottomless portafilter (for the mentioned devices, two-ear 51mm)  
\*- a filter pitcher for your tap water, like a Britta, Maxfor, or similar - prevents limescale buildup, improves coffee taste, extraction, and consistency, helps with the device maintenance and longevity  
\- a puck screen (to help with water distribution and to help keep the machine clean), 51mm for the mentioned devices  
\- a small manual dust blower (like one for camera equipment, usually rubber) - helps with keeping the machine and grinder clean  
\- a small (magnetic) mirror to watch the shots  
\- small espresso cups, preferably double-walled glass, from 50 to 90 ml  
\- a wide coffee cup for making latte art coffee (latte, cappuccino, etc)  
\- coffee tasting spoons  
\- a digital food thermometer to check your temperatures from time to time  
\- ""Barista"" labeled milk alternatives (some of them foam better than regular milk or add some different flavors to the coffee)  
\- Allulose for sweetening if you like to drink sweet coffee drinks, alternatively, Erythritol or Xylitol.  
\- a container or box for the coffee beans, and freeze the beans if you're keeping them for more than a week  
Spend the rest on a grinder. And get freshly roasted coffee (if supermarket beans without a mentioned roast date, the roast date is usually the expiration date minus two years). Coffee beans are food-safe for many years if stored correctly, but they lose most of their CO2 in a matter of weeks after roasting.

18g of coffee beans, 36g of the drink, in about 30 seconds, is what one should aim for as a starting point.

Additional recommended tools for different coffee brewing:  
\- a Hario V60 or similar pour-over dripper  
\- Paper filters for the mentioned dripper  
\- a gooseneck kettle (easier water pouring)  
\- a French Press  
\- a Vietnamese Phin dripper  
\- a 3-cup to 6-cup Mokka pot  
\- an AeroPress  
\- a cheap milk frotting wand (but steam your milk using the espresso machine)  
\- a larger digital scale that can fit/measure a bigger cup or a French press, a dripper, etc  
\- coffee spices, cinnamon

If I want to buy a ‚Äòhigh-end hifi there are stores in most cities and large towns across the UK where I can go and look at the items and try them before deciding whether to buy. Where I live, within a one hour drive radius there are probably 10 or so stores where I can go to buy a ¬£20k hifi if I wish. All of the new hifi I have ever bought I have looked at first then listened to before buying.

However if I want to buy an espresso machine at the Lelit/Profitec/ECM etc level there seem to be a small handful of retailers in the UK from whom I can order online. I only know of one in the UK which has an actual showroom where I could even view, much less try, one of these machines before buying. Generally I have to buy mail order and ‚Äòblind‚Äô - relying on YouTube reviews and Reddit recommendations. If I receive it and then don‚Äôt like it well then‚Ä¶tough really.

Then there is the quality. When I buy a piece of high-end hifi I expect pretty stellar quality and performance, with superb longevity.

When I buy a high end espresso machine (judging from the YouTube reviews, Reddit discussions etc because that‚Äôs all I have to go on), I get steam knobs that look like they‚Äôve been lifted from a milk carton, water tanks that look like badly modified Tupperware containers with a couple of plastic tubes stuck in (sorry not meaning to pick on you in particular Lelit), drip trays that rattle loudly when a shot is being pulled (Profitec), or for many machines if I suddenly decide I want a random coffee in the afternoon I have to wait circa 30 minutes for the damn machine to warm up - 30 minutes!!!

Does this all indicate that the market for such espresso machines in the UK is just too small to make any showrooms economically viable? And that the worldwide market is too small to justify the R&D and testing to make higher quality espresso machines generally? Do I need to really pay La Marzocco or Slayer prices to get a decent quality basic espresso machine?

Finding the espresso machine market hard to fathom! Or am I missing some fundamentals here that explain why this market is so different from many others?"

I lean towards medium roasts. I lean towards chocolate notes, nutty notes like almond, but not hazelnut. 

As harvests and seasons change, so do the notes of the roasts. My old fave was Unicorn Blood from Dark Matter Coffee, it used to have a strong peanut buttery smell when ground, and that carried into the espresso. 

Lattes and Cortados are my preferred drinking method, and I do sweeten a touch. 

I am not afraid of premium prices, as I want premium product. I explore from time to time and have probably done a good 50-60 bean roasts over the past 3-4 years. 

Recommendations wanted!!! Preference where I can buy more than 12oz at a time. "

I has the dum. I need a healthy discussion about machines. Any questions welcome as I am certain I am forgetting to mention something. "

2,2025-07-02,Is it my grinder or is it just me? [Lelit Elizabeth/Varia VS3],u/saltyN1ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lpza8p/is_it_my_grinder_or_is_it_just_me_lelit/,"Getting great tasting espresso seems kind of impossible for me. I started with a Breville Bambino + Varia VS3 (Gen 1) in around 2022, and I recently upgraded to a Lelit Elizabeth. Though I normally make milk drinks - which I generally can't complain about - I haven't really been able to consistently pull shots which taste ""good"". For medium/medium-dark roasts, I'm able to get something which has a traditional flavour profile, but besides that I haven't been able to extract any of the nice flavours listed on the bag, or ones I can taste at a cafe. I would ideally like to buy medium/medium light roasts to pull at home.

I typically go for 16/17g in, 36-42g out in about 25-35 seconds. I use a WDT, and a puck screen to keep things clean. When I try to dial in, grinding finer usually results with something that tastes like battery acid, and grinding coarser results in a turbo shot that is also sour, or doesn't taste like anything good. Even when the timing and yields look about right, the flavours never really shine through. I try to buy from local roasters, either single origin or house blends and the beans are never roasted for more than a month from when I buy them. I've tried many different roasts, but with almost all of them I face the same issue. 

Since I upgraded my espresso machine recently, I've begun to suspect it's the grinder at fault - I've noticed when cleaning my grinder (which I do monthly) I notice a huge amount of fines that I have to clean out, which might be causing the issues. I've experimented with slow feeding my grinder but it takes far too long, it doesn't seem help too much and I just end up with hugely inconsistent shots.

Having said that... is it just me not being able to dial in properly? Do I need more experience dialling in by taste? Could it be the water (we have medium-hard water from tap)? Or is this something where a better grinder would help me?"

I've had my beloved Bambino Plus for about 3 weeks now and have been diving head-first into the espresso rabbit hole (send help... or beans).

I‚Äôve been pulling shots using 17g of beans (roasted \~1.5 weeks ago), ground on my KINGgrinder P2 set to \~20 clicks. I WDT and tamp like I know what I‚Äôm doing, but let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî me and my taste testers are all blissfully ignorant and easily impressed.

The shots *taste* pretty good ‚Äî but I‚Äôm still learning what to *look* for. This particular pull felt a bit slow to me and took a while to form a single stream. I haven‚Äôt been timing my shots religiously (I know, espresso sins), but eyeballing it feels like it might be choking a bit?

Puck came out clean and easy in one solid piece ‚Äî no swamping or breakage, so prep seems decent?

I think that it would be hilarious to jump scare a waiter for instance and have them drop a plate on the floor. Additionally to jump scare a bunch of customers from behind and hopefully have them spill their coffee on themselves

Speaking of coffee. I think it would be hilarious to grab a few people‚Äôs coffee cups and throw them at the walls and create cool looking splash patterns all over the walls

I also think it would be funny if the cafe has one of those blackboard menus up the front to have a blackboard eraser and chalk on hand and modify the menu slightly. Price down half the items

Obviously if I went ahead and tried these I‚Äôd get into serious trouble IRL however the mindset I have is I think this would make for a funny scene on a tv show or movie or something. I love chaotic/prank scenarios

Temperature:
I‚Äôve tried different temperature: 92C, 95C, 98C. I also checked the thermostat accuracy by flash boiling. 

Pressure:
I tried 12bar, 9bar and 8bar.

Ground distribution:
I tried with or without proper WDT. I use a bottomless portafilter and usually don‚Äôt see jets.

Beans:
I tried all different roast levels from different roasterie. But even with the dark roast I still got only sourness and astringency. (And for sure it is not the bean problem, since I tried the same beans in the shop and it has absolute sourness and astringency)

Dose and ratio:
I tried from 13g to 18g. Usually with a ratio of 1:2.25. 

Flow:
The flow is weird. I can hardly finish the shot for more than 35s. I aim for 30s, and for a lot of settings the shot will finish in 25-30s and be very sour. I can choke the machine. But even if the grind setting is just a little coarser than the choking setting, I got an astringency shot. The flow will usually starts at 5s, about 0.6g/s. But will gradually increase to 1.7-2g/s. 
I feel confused since Lance Hedrick mentioned a lot of times that the flow will normally be decreasing instead of increasing.
I worried that maybe some channeling keep happening, since the flow always keep increasing through the shot, and stabilize at 1.7-2g/s. But I saw no holes in the puck after the shot, and saw no sputtering jet for most of the shots.

I now only expect to get an acceptable dark roast espresso with no sourness and astringency. Even an overly bitter one will be good.

Please help me! Thank you!

(I do pour over for 5 years and can get good coffee easily for all roast levels. So I think my sense of flavor is reliable.)"

I was able to get fairly consistent shots and had immense flavors.  I think part of the reason walso was that I was able to easily take out the water reservoir and dump it and put fresh filtered water in and I think that made a huge difference. 

I then upgraded to a dual boiler and it's been a few years since.  I love the machine for what it can do but over the years, I noticed that there is a pretty huge quality difference after I clean the machine running a cycle, cleaning the reservoir of grime buildup etc.  but only after a few more shots, I'm back to where I left off.

The shots still taste ok but there's definitely a big difference from the first, I would say, few shots pull after a cleaning cycle.

Can anyone share their experience and if there's anything I can do to maintain better / ""cleaner"" shots over a longer period of time?  I'm wondering if this could potentially be a limitation of the Breville dual boiler maybe due toore hoses, or whatever. "

Machines:
	‚Ä¢	Breville Bambino Plus (seems easy to use with auto milk frothing)
	‚Ä¢	Gaggia Classic Pro (heard it‚Äôs better for learning the ‚Äúreal‚Äù process)
	‚Ä¢	De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica (compact and beginner-friendly)

Grinders:
	‚Ä¢	Baratza Encore ESP
	‚Ä¢	Eureka Mignon Specialita
	‚Ä¢	Fellow Opus

My budget isn‚Äôt super strict, but ideally under $1000 USD (or ‚Ç¨900ish). I just want something that gives me room to grow without being overly complicated right out of the box.

Any recommendations or setups you love? Is there anything you wish you‚Äôd bought first instead of what you started with? Also curious about favorite beginner beans and any must-have accessories.

Over the last 5 years I've tried anything from silicone mats to adhesive wallpaper and laminate, without being completely satisfied.

Silicone will do the job if you're not fussy about static buildup and the cheap look. It will also wrinkle as time passes. Laminate and wallpaper type solutions is very slippery, so every time I engaged the portafilter the machine would move. Eventually it breaks the material underneath and you're back to the start.

I came across Grovemade. They typically make home office/workspace solutions, but I noticed that the Desk Pad in linoleum would probably do the job and it certainly did. A month in, I'm finally at the end station in terms of a workable solution for the countertop.

The Desk Pad has a layer of cork underneath the linoleum, which keeps it in place. The linoleum is very easy to keep clean, as opposed to silicone. Highly recommend."

I've been using my Normcore portafilter (with a wooden handle) for almost a year now and just 2 months ago I noticed my handle came off quite easily. It seems like the glue or whatever is used (to keep the basket and the handle together) no longer works, which makes the handle loosen more easily. I live in Southeast Asia with high humidity, hence I suspect it might be one of the reasons. I also noticed the same thing happened to my coffee stirrer (also from Normcore): the main body (made of walnut) also comes off quite easily.

I will purchase a new handle to replace the current one. Although the wooden handle looks aesthetically pleasing, I will need to switch to a different material just to make sure that it will stay intact for years.

  
Has anyone experienced the same problem with Normcore portafilter and stirrer?

I‚Äôve had several other grinders before and during its tenure. I‚Äôve been doing home espresso for about two decades and I‚Äôve rotated a lot of gear in that time. I see tons of recommendations for 64mm burr machines in exactly the same price range as the atom. 

Recently I picked up a Monolith Flat Max 3. It‚Äôs a completely different beast and I love it, but it‚Äôs given me an even greater appreciation for the Atom. 

The atom has a wider grind distribution making it very easy to dial in and stay dialed in. Its grind setting is incredibly responsive without being cumbersome. The grind quality is absolutely excellent and consistent. I‚Äôve used it without making changes to the grind setting across several bags of coffee and when I do need to dial in it‚Äôs almost always a small adjustment. I exclusively drink light roasts so this is no easy task.

I upgraded hoping for workflow improvements as it‚Äôs just an ‚Äúok‚Äù single dose grinder. But having owned a niche zero and now the kafatek I would also say they are just ‚Äúok‚Äù and just different workflows not really better. I consistently get .1-.2g retention with the puffer lid. 

It‚Äôs also very quiet. 

I‚Äôve had several 64mm burr grinders and they always seemed like a weird compromise to me. Yes there are some excellent burr designs out there (ssp making some great stuff) but nothing that strikes the balance of the burrs in the 75.

I know there‚Äôs a new GBW version and that‚Äôs great and all but the regular version has served me well with zero issues across some really finicky coffees. For the price I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs anything better for espresso. You‚Äôd need to pay significantly more to make improvements and even then it‚Äôs incremental at best."

Some additional context:

I've been brewing coffee in my moka pot for the last two years, mastering the technique, but I've always wanted to get some good espresso, as the local coffee shops in my area are a terrible hit or miss (mostly miss).  
I've found a deal mentioned in the title although there are some caveats:  
\- it's used and not tested by the seller. The buttons light up, the electronics work and theoretically everything should be fine and they do offer a 14-day no questions asked return policy.  
\- I've got no experience with espresso machines and don't know what problems i should potentially expect from a used one.

Regarding the grinder, which some people complain about - I know you can adjust them so that it grinds finer, that should work, right? Also, I do have a TimeMore C3ESP PRO I use with my moka. No clue whether it should be better than the built in one."

3,2025-07-03,Flair Classic's second wind,u/salpara,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lqsre8/flair_classics_second_wind/,"I've had this Flair Classic since probably 2017 or so and have used it at least three times a day ever since. After a trip to Europe, I thought about getting a new machine to upgrade the Flair. The Flair has been great, but after all those years of manual pressing, it just sounded nice to get an automatic machine. Little did I know, I was about to be reintroduced to this machine I'd felt desperate to move beyond. I'd already upgraded our grinder, got a WDT tool, and I was reading up on machines in the $400-500 range. That led me to videos about dialing in shots, measuring ratios, all of that stuff I assume readers here know well. 

I'm new here. I've just been making Americanos for years on my Flair without heating up the chamber, grinding coarsely, not measuring anything, no pre-infusion, and using pretty cheap beans. And the coffee was still better, to me, than a lot of what I'd get out (usually ordering Americanos or drip coffee). 

So, researching a new machine and learning about dialing in had me start testing on the Flair Classic. Whoa. I can't believe how good the coffee is that I'm making now. It's astonishing. And I'm really enjoying the whole process, which had previously become a pain in the ass that I was looking to escape.

Now I'm not sure what to do. I could get a used Turin Legato V2 for $300, get a Bambino, or just keep making killer shots on my Classic. I can't upgrade it because it's the old version. I'm just a bit worried that I'll get a new machine and it won't make shots as good as the Flair I've had underperforming for eight years and that now I better understand. I also realize that I'm just at the beginning and can certainly improve my espresso as I learn, using only the stuff I've got now (and better, fresher beans). 

Anyways, cheers to a new life for an old classic. "

Lately I‚Äôve been testing different brew methods for that like AeroPress, V60, even espresso. I pulled a shot using my OutIn Nano (it was handy while visiting my folks), and surprisingly the crema brought out more of that sweet jammy taste I‚Äôd missed in the pour-over. Totally different from my Breville.

We have a delonghi burr grinder, which isn't amazing, but is decent enough for us at this point.

We drink mainly black coffee (espresso or americano), so we don't need any bells and whistles when it comes to milk frothing, so I'm thinking a Bambino Plus isn't worth the extra money (unless I'm missing something with the other features?). We enjoy our coffee, but aren't at the point where we are wanting to get technical about it. We're in Canada, and would like to keep the price around $500 CAD or less, but also something that will last more than 2-3 years.

I've been trying to find information about the Bambino - I read reviews that there are issues with the Plus one leaking around the drip tray, but can't find if that is also a problem with the OG? We have a butcher block counter, so definitely don't want to have to worry about leaking or water collecting under the machine. I also saw with the Plus that it shuts down after 200 shots and you can't override that at all, you have to stop and do a cleaning cycle. Does that happen with the OG as well? (Sorry - it's been really hard to find a lot on the OG, as most reviews are about the Plus).

They said they could do it, but that it was **hard to measure** (even though they had a portafilter manometer?) and that the adjustment would be **irreversible**. They brought it down to **10 bars**, but I still feel that‚Äôs too high.

When dialing in, I reach a point where the grind is fine enough to get closer to the right shot time, but then I start getting **channeling**‚Äîthe shot starts slow and then suddenly **gushes out**. If I go one notch coarser, the shot runs too fast. So I feel a bit stuck between **channeling at fine** and **under-extraction at coarse**.

Also, I believe the Oscar II does a **5-second pre-infusion**, followed by another \~5 seconds before reaching full pressure, which complicates things further.

Has anyone else experienced this with the Oscar II?   
Is there a way to reliably lower the pressure further (closer to 9 bars)? Any insight on that ‚Äúirreversible‚Äù adjustment would also help.

I‚Äôve been absolutely loving the Lelit Anna V2 since getting one new on sale last month!

The mfg. date is mid 2023, if that helps narrow down revision and any build quirks. 

So far, I‚Äôve adjusted the PID offset by 5C, and reduced the OPV setting down to 9.5 bars (blind filter).

Any other adjustments I should make to get the most out of it?

How about any new accessories to buy to get the most out of the machine?

I've known about this for some time, but in my ignorance assumed that mean drip filter coffee, and I'm not drinking that. Then I discovered espresso basket filters and that people are using these to improve their coffee in any case ... duh, clearly I am not a professional. Anyway, to the dumb question - I have a Breville Express (don't judge, as I said not a pro) and I use the single shot basket. Would I use a filter paper that covers just the holes in the middle of the basket (about 28mm) or the same ones that would go in the double-shot basket (about 45mm I think)?

I tried disassembling the pump and switching the ball and gasket everyone does - they look brand new.
Before I go and buy a new pump - is there something I‚Äôm missing? 
It‚Äôs either a faulted pump or a clogged boiler, if the boiler is clogged then water would come out of the free hose after the pump.

Just wanted to list off what I've seen scattered around my post and others (either here on reddit or on some blog) for those who actually got them to pop in and say what they must!

1zpresso was the most talked about by far, seem to have a humongous lineup! Just wouldn't know the exact difference between the models as their website kinda shrouds it in mystery not directly comparing the 11 of them. But who also peaked my interest was ...

Kingrinder with their army of people swearing by the k6, the price point at $100 is just unbeatable, have heard no complaints!

Also thanks to u/[dadudster](https://www.reddit.com/user/dadudster/) for responding on a 2 year old thread within one hour to tell me that the POTU flat burr on Aliexpress was not half bad and gets some nice results especially for light roasts.

Timemore was a name thrown around a few times, but was among Comandante and Kinu with the least opinions on them - at least from what I've seen and read :-)

Are y'all passionate about any of these grinders, are any DEFINITELY worth the purchase over any other or better and more frivolous yet: did I forget any? :D Let me know, I'm curious."

Right now my recipe is basically free handing everything so I'd love to hear about your more precise experiments! 

Do not reproduce 1:1 but here's what I do with what I have : 
* Bunch of ice cubes in a 20cl fancy-looking cold glass
* Fill to 3/4 with tonic (I currently suboptimally have Lemon flavoured Schweppes but before I had Elderflower Fever Tree and that was delicious)
* 3 drops of saline solution
* A dash of vinegar to balance out this Kenyan dark roast that's on the bitter side (currently raspberry vinegar but that wouldn't be my first choice, what would you recommend?)
* Always debating adding an extra sweetener like orgeat, the tiniest amount, to round it up 
* Double shot of espresso, layered - I take a first sip and then stir. 

My recipe is clearly all over the place... I'm relatively new to mixology so I'm trying to be everywhere at once. So far I haven't measured anything (except the espresso) so I guess that's where I need to start to perfect the drink. Ideally I would do without acidifyer and sweetener but I just love the process of adding more stuff to my drink LOL. It makes for a very in-your-face beverage, and honestly that's not the best compliment one would give. I personnaly really enjoy it, mostly for its funkiness, but I want to refine it. Surely I must start by stocking better-suited tonic. I imagine different beans would totally remake the drink as well - I'm not really familiar with origins specifics yet, so feel free to mensplain me! I'm really looking forward to hear about your espresso tonic, hope others will enjoy that too !! "

Got it second hand a few months ago and it needed the the shower screen replaced as the plastic parts had cracked. After replacing the shower screen and gasket with a stainless steel kit from IMS it‚Äôs been working well since‚Ä¶ until about a week ago, and since then every shot I pull isn‚Äôt building any pressure and is flowing far too quickly.

I‚Äôve tried different baskets and portafilers, New and old beans, kept my puck between 18-19g and gradually reduced the grind until my grinder had been binding.
This has got my thinking that something isn‚Äôt sealing right and the water is bypassing the puck-  at least partially. However, when using a naked portafilter, the water does at least appear to be flowing through the basket.

When using a blind basket the machine is able to build pressure to around 9 bars where it previously sat during my extraction.

I‚Äôm using a safe barista pro with a grid size of 1. I‚Äôve already adjusted the internal burrs once when I got the machine, and I‚Äôll probably need to do so again if I want to grind finer.

I‚Äôm not sure if this is a channeling problem or a grind size problem. I use a spring-loaded tamp and a distribution tool for my puck prep. The distribution tool I got off AliExpress is a circular object that fits the portable and has multiple needles underneath. Could this be the problem?

¬†I am Yvonne, the product designer from Team OutIn here! I am thrilled to kick off this AMA and share our journey crafting easy-to-use, high-performance coffee tools for life on the go. We've poured our hearts into each product, combining thoughtful design, real-world testing, and a bit of fun adventure along the way.¬†

Our journey began with a simple frustration: why is it so hard to get good coffee when you‚Äôre not at home? We‚Äôre outdoor lovers, travelers, and remote workers, and we wanted real espresso, not compromises. So we built tools that could *travel well and brew better*.¬† Ask me anything about OutIn Nano, Fino, Claro, or anything coffee-related!

Starting with portable espresso gear- here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve built so far:

* **OutIn Nano**:¬† Our OG portable espresso machine. 20-bar pressure, USB-C powered, compatible with ground coffee & pods. Small enough to throw in a backpack.
* **Fino Grinder**:¬† Compact, cordless, and crazy consistent. 38mm burrs, 28 grind settings, and a sleek design that actually fits in your hand.
* **Claro Scale**:¬† Smart, waterproof, and travel-ready. Brew modes for espresso and pour-over with precision down to 0.1g.

So, are you curious how we managed to pack 20-bar pressure and fast heating into the Nano? Wondering how the Fino holds up against other portable grinders? Maybe you‚Äôre trying to dial in your Nano + Claro combo for better flow control or just want to geek out about flavors, brew ratios, and travel coffee setups? We‚Äôre here for all of it.¬†

u/Substantial-Sir-4483 will be answering your questions.

I can follow suggested in/out/time expectations but I don't know how it applies if I use preinfusion. How much time should I add to the TBT? Adding the amount of preinfusion time I set the machine to doesn't exactly work because liquid immediately comes out once preinfusion ends, but without preinfusion, liquid comes out some seconds after pressing the button.

So far I've been dialing based only on in/out/approximate time (as long as it's not way under 20s or way over 40s). The pressure gauge on this machine I've heard it kind of inaccurate as well so I don't know how much I trust it.

I have only pulled one shot so far, so I am far from dialed in, but I was hoping for a little bit of troubleshooting help!

I have not zeroed my DF54 (I am scared to wreck the burrs) but I ground 18g of a dark roast (sorry, but I love dark roast and I want to stay here) at 15 on the grinder.

I could not get 18g of the ground beans into the tamper. I think I lost 3g. Obviously when I poured the shot, the puck was too wet - although I did get approx. 36g in just under 30 seconds.

There is not a lot of information about brewing dark roasts so I am hoping for a bit of guidance on what I can expect.

Should I be aiming for less that 18g for a double shot? I feel like the grind level was close to being okay there just wasn't enough coffee in the basket. How do I compensate for the dark roast?

Thanks!"

1. Heat up time: I see 45min of heat up time but how quick can you get it if you start flushing? what's the quickest you can get it ready to pull good shot? I know you can put a smart plug but in a scenario where you want an unplanned shot...
2. Air in the chamber: How big of deal is it that there is air in the chamber and the machine does not have a release valve (bleed valve)?
3. Light roast: I drink 95% medium roast and my wife is 100% dark roast. Saying that, is the Profitec able to pull light roast? I keep reading R24 being better for light roast.
4. and importantly, would you recommend this machine??

I‚Äôm in a frustrating spot and could really use the collective wisdom (and maybe some moral support) of this subreddit.

The situation:

* I was gifted a Gaggia Classic Evo Pro earlier this year.
* Recently, I learned about and subsequently discovered the infamous ‚ÄúBoilergate‚Äù issue‚Äîmy water has black specks/flakes.
* I reached out to r/wholelattelove u/wholelattelove (US distributor) and they offered a free aluminum boiler replacement‚Ä¶ but only if I could provide an original proof of purchase, which I don't have.

Why this feels wrong:

1. Known manufacturing defect. Boilergate is a well known issue, and many users have shared photos.
2.  warranty. Unless I am wrong, consumer‚Äêprotection laws ensure a product must be free from serious defects‚Äîeven if you can‚Äôt locate your receipt.
3. Receipts have been unneded by others. I‚Äôve seen posts of people getting free replacements without havng to provide up an invoice.
4. No purchase record = not my fault. It was a gift; I never received a receipt. But why should people getting something as a gift not be protected in the same way as anyone who bought it and kept it?

Where I am now:

* after many back and forth messages with WLL customer svc. They‚Äôve flatly refused to send me the boiler unless I produce an order number or receipt.
* I thought it would be a fair compromise to ask them for a code or discount on the brass boiler upgrade, which I would be happy to pay something for, but they said zero discount available, sorry.
* It seems like the burden of proof is being unfairly shoved onto me so they don't have to pay for something that is clearly the manufacturer/distributor's responsibility

Has anyone else hit this exact wall with WLL? How did you convince them to budge? am I off base for expecting them to do right by customers when it‚Äôs a known defect?"

After 5 years of using my Breville Barista Express, I still argue with myself about whether anyone really needs to upgrade from this.  But in the vain of shiny object syndrome and the love of aesthetics mixed with a lil bit of ""treat yo'self"", I set up my Ascaso Steel DUO PID Plus next to my Zerno Z1.

For starters, I spent about 2 weeks learning my Zerno while pulling shots on the Breville which was a really fulfilling process not only because I am recording every shot I grind with the Zerno over 30 days in an attempt to demonstrate if and how a flat burr grinder can get you the body you seek, but also because it really call upon the knowledge I've gained when it comes to the art and science of extraction.  TL:DR - you ABSOLUTELY can get the most perfect body from a flat burr set (he said, preaching to the choir).

In comes the Ascaso.  Now, I knew to some extent I would have to do some acclimating to the new machine, but despite such a thing never having happened ever in history prior, it turned out there was more acclimating than I anticipated.  I departed from the Breville at 19g in ground at 210¬µm with 38g out at 45 seconds which is my preferred flow rate.  Did I mention it had perfect body?

First shot on the Ascaso: 18g, 210¬µm.  And the result: one of the wackiest shots I've ever pulled.  Channeling galore, spurting like fireworks on the fourth of July (wait a minute, that's today).  Mid way, there was so much spurting that enough espresso got on my scale for it to give me an H2) warning and stopped measuring, so who knows what the heck came out at the end.

Round 2, this time 18g @ 225¬µm.  This is where things got interesting.  My initial flow rate was seemingly on a faster side; I anticipated somewhere between 25 and 30 seconds.  Then the weird thing happened; the weight started increasing more slowly, and I noticed my shot glass reaching over 3/4 full to only then reach 36g.  What the...

Round 3: 18g @ 215¬µm.  Super slow pull, still a mess, but this time, an expected volume at 36g, thought it took a full minute.  Then I remembered the OPV...

I've heard some say that your manometry should be something you adjust via the puck, but that sounds like complete nonsense to me if I'm trying to get the thing down from 11 bar to 9.  So adjust the OPV to 9 I did.

Round 4: back up to 225¬µm, this time with a new bar in my life.  This time we managed to avoid the mess...ish.  But more importantly was again this large volume to get to the same weight.  However, this time I was paying more attention and connecting the dots.  The flow was getting super pale and transparent in the latter half.  So, over extraction led to water with minimal solute, which led to lighter weight by volume.  Fascinating.

Then it dawned on me; at any given column of grinds in the puck, at 58mm the height of that columns is going to be less, so of course resistance will be less overall at a particular grind size.  But if that's the case, shouldn't it flow faster?  Why is it taking so long to get my shot?

Oh yeah, the thinning...

I had to sit down and scratch my head on this one for a bit.  It called on the basics.  I went so far back to the foundations I was even stroking my beard a one point.  At the end of the day, flow rate can be controlled by the density of the puck.  That is grind size and dry dose.  I refuse to change my dry dose for now, so how do I fix both issues that on the surface seem counter to each other?

Perhaps if I slow the flow rate down further, it'll take longer to get to that point of over-extraction.  Worth a shot.  Excuse me while I vomit from that pun.  But this meant that I would try to drop the grind size significantly to slow down the flow in the hopes that I might not rinse the beans too quickly.  This, perhaps, would also provide the right amount of resistance for ultimately a puck of lesser stature, being a 58mm filter.  

Final Round: 18g, 175¬µm.  And the verdict: It'll do.  36.5g out, minimal channeling, about 54 seconds.  Yes, long I know, but that's my jam.  The only issue I was seeing was that the crema and body of the shot were lacking.  But at this point, I felt brave enough to just go with this shot and proceed with my latte.

As it turned out, it was one of the best lattes I've ever made.  Damn you, unconscious boundless genius!

Thinking of buying a grinder to leave there so I don't have to travel with mine.

Any suggestions?

Smaller the better, electric, doesn't have to be great quality (Oxo quality is fine, but Oxo is pretty large), cheaper the better, AliExpress knockoffs that people have good results with is fine too. It's for like 30 days a year of use once a day. Single dosing would be nice.

I'm some what of a 'late bloomer' in my introduction to coffee, but in an effort to kick a zero sugar cola addiction I decided to make the switch. Now that doesn't mean I'd never drank coffee before, but we certainly never had any in our house.

Knowing damn well that most pods would be just as bad for my health as the cola and having a thirst for knowledge on 'how things work', I bought myself a cheap hand grinder and a moka pot and started experimenting. It was a great way to get a very basic understanding of grind size and brew time, but there is only so far you can go with it on this setup. So... I start trawling FB marketplace in search of a bargain.

Initially missed out on a Rancilio Silvia Pro which was out of my budget anyhow, but first landed this reasonably new BDB, and shortly after a DF54 for a total spend of $700aud. Now the learning curve starts ALL OVER AGAIN! üò´üòÖ

Have probably gone through 300g of coffee so far and haven't quite got it right as yet. Things I've learnt so far;

‚Ä¢ NEED proper coffee scales to measure weight and time. My normal kitchen scales don't go to 0.1g and the vibratory pump sees it bounce around while pulling the shot rendering them useless. Scales on their way.

‚Ä¢The double spout portafilter isn't helping me assess the effectiveness of my puck prep. Naked portafilter also on its way.

Would love if those part way along their journey could share the one piece of advice or that one 'eureka!' moment you wish you were given right from the start?

163,2025-07-05,Coffee in Tokyo Day 2,u/ninemoonblues,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ls53oq/coffee_in_tokyo_day_2/,"So I went on a meandering walkabout today. I got to check out one place from a redditor suggestion - Philocoffea, one on my list About Life Coffee, and a return visit to glitch, but at their other location (wanted to buy their drinkware). Everything I got was pour over, with glitch being one hot and one cold. Overall, here are my thoughts. 

About Life Coffee - Onibus Rwanda beans - (first photo) it's fine coffee. It felt like it wasn't in the same category as everything else. i.e. It's a caf√© while the others are more bespoke coffee 'bars'. Got a ham and cheese sando with it too. That was good, but I didn't like the thick cut ham though (fat wasn't fully rendered, so those parts were tough).

Philocoffea - 539 Ethiopian - (pix 2-4) thoroughly underwhelming experience. Great customer service, I had a lovely chat with the barista as he made my drink, but the flavor profile didn't come through to what the tasting notes indicated. I do NOT like the minimalist industrial vibe. Nowhere to sit. Only place to set your drink fits about 3-4 people while VERY SAD plants occupy the corner of in a giant concrete room (which is basically empty), being deprived of sunlight. They are located in the basement of a building. Has the most ridiculously accessible bathroom I've ever seen (pictured), like totally opposite vibe from everything else - sheer toiletry maximalism. Overall feels unfinished, like they ran out of money.

Glitch (Jinbocho location) - Honduras (hot) and Colombia (cold) - OK so the two locations were very different experiences. BOTH had WONDERFUL aromas when you walk in (Jinbocho is where they do the actual roasting). Something no other place had. I really enjoy being able to smell the beans before making a decision, at Ginza it really helped me notice the differences between the options. For whatever reason, the beans at Jinbocho all smelled fairly similar. As for the coffee itself, I was pretty meh on both. Not bad not great. Maybe my palate was wrecked by now, IDK. I kinda wish I did the Colombia hot as well. 

Overall I liked the first two drinks I had at glitch yesterday the most (see previous post), and wound up buying 150g of the Campo Hermoso to take home. They give you a brew profile and a sample of the grind size so you can replicate at home (really cool, IMO). Didn't get the drinkware, they were sold out. 

I feel like regardless of who's doing the brewing, which beans you choose can vary the tasting outcome wildly.*

Glitch by far was the best _experience_ out of all. The thoughtfulness put in to the process really made it stand out. They were also hands down the most busy/popular (with PHILOCOFFEA being eerily vacant - they're also in what I felt like is a weird neighborhood). 

Tomorrow I plan to visit Apollon's Gold for their espresso (another reddit rec.). The other multi-course tasting experience that was suggested sounds really cool, but I'm not going to do it. Don't have the time, and don't want to spend $130 on it. 

I'll be heading to Kyoto and Osaka as well, if you have recommendations in those locations! 

*Disclaimer - I do not have an exceptionally refined palate for coffee. With that said, again the drinks from glitch (Ginza) were the most accurate to the tasting notes. Also, I don't have a strong understanding of the different processing methods (washed, honey, natural, etc.), and how they can impact the overall flavor profile. 

I've enjoyed the tour, will keep it going while on this trip. I'm happy to check out anywhere else, time permitting. Let me know!"

I guess this question came up in other treads, but I'm lazy to search.

I'm looking for a semi automated espresso machine to replace my Delonghi Magnifica that it still doing a great job after 15 years of service (+/- 6 cups per day). But it's a mess to clean up inside and the quality of espresso is far from what I like.

  
So, my use case for a new machine would be to handle automatically must of the manual tasks, meaning automatic grinding, embedded tamping system and automated brewing.

I don't have time to spent on doing the best cup by hands and most the time I have max 1 minute to make me a cup between 2 calls. So of use will come as important as the quality of the brew.

Also, I'd like my machine to last a few years. Build quality and reparability is important for me

I like my espresso the Italian way to do it with dark roasted beans. I only drink espresso so I don't care about foaming milk, cold brew and other fancy stuffs.

Max budget will be \[800‚Ç¨\]. I'm located in Europe.

So, after some searches, I found out 4 candidates :

\- Delonghi La Specialista Opera

\- Sage/Breville Barista Express Impress

\- Ninja Luxe Cafe Pro

\- Philips Baristana

I got my hands on a Sage Bambino Plus that the previous owner said was not functioning. I already own and love one myself and was hoping for a bargain to give to a friend.

Unfortunately there is no water coming out and it does not seem to be one of the easy fixes.

I primed the pump and disconnected the incoing hose at the heating element and it gets water there. But when I connect the heating element and disconect the next hose that leads to a valve the water comes out at the weakest joint right at the entry of the heating element.

Took the element out and tried to push vinegar through with a syringe, but no chance.  
Also I am not able to blow through the element. Considering how small the diameter of the coil is, I am not sure if I SHOULD be able to get water/air through with the little pressure I can build up or if I just have to make that hose connection super strong again, so the pump can push through.

What are your thoughts?

I dont think buying a replacement heat element when there is clearly a risk of other parts down the line beeing broken, would be a smart choice"

At some point I got a cheap delonghi espresso machine and used that manual grinder (after a ton of troubleshooting getting the right grind). It was never worth the toil of a manual grind to get bad espresso so I ended up not using the machine much and getting rid of it. That was about 5 years ago and today I spent 3 hours making about 20 grinds of 15 grams in order to get an extraction on the flair. I would change the grinder one click and it would either be too fine or too coarse. In order to grind my coffee it was about 75 cranks and very difficult at times. Once I gave up because there was no way I was going to get the right grind I decide to look up the ‚Äúgood quality‚Äù grinder I assumed I had. I have no idea where it came from but I believed it to be a $100+ burr grinder. It is in fact the ‚Äúhario‚Äù skerton plus coffee grinder not meant for espresso whatsoever. Not a single one of the 20+ attempts cranking the grinder mattered whatsoever and it was a complete waste of time. I immediately ordered the timemore c3 pro so I can finally have a real espresso grinder. Just feel like and idiot for 7 years of my high quality espresso grinder really costing about $40

Some additional context:

I've been brewing coffee in my moka pot for the last two years, mastering the technique, but I've always wanted to get some good espresso, as the local coffee shops in my area are a terrible hit or miss (mostly miss).  
I've found a deal mentioned in the title although there are some caveats:  
\- it's used and not tested by the seller. The buttons light up, the electronics work and theoretically everything should be fine and they do offer a 14-day no questions asked return policy.  
\- I've got no experience with espresso machines and don't know what problems i should potentially expect from a used one.

Regarding the grinder, which some people complain about - I know you can adjust them so that it grinds finer, that should work, right? Also, I do have a TimeMore C3ESP PRO I use with my moka. No clue whether it should be better than the built in one."

The new burrs have obvious, visible, and sometimes deep surface defects. It is my understanding that these should be precision-machined parts. I got a replacement set, and those too had defects. I contacted customer service and they say ""that's just how they are."" I am hugely disappointed.

I have been searching for third party 55mm burrs and can't find any. I can only find one source for Eureka replacement burrs (VeryBarista, and I am in USA in case that matters).

I feel like I am stuck. Can anyone offer perspective or options? I quite like my grinder, but I like my light roasts even more. For now I am using a 1zpresso j-series and it is great for all coffee, but I didn't get it to be my daily driver."

I was reluctant to replace the pump for the first two years I owned it to not void the warranty, so I just installed the self-stick sound deadening panels only, which maybe made a slight difference.  And after the warranty had expired I was dragging my feet to swap out the pump because I've never done something like that before even though I knew that would be beneficial sound-wise.  

I then [ran across this vid](https://www.reddit.com/r/ranciliosilvia/comments/1kayc2o/my_stealthy_silvia_v3_before_vs_after_pump/)  that inspired me to just jump in and 'do it'.  u/DivoNOR thank you!

[Here is the video that shows startup before and after, and pulling a quiet shot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rAqVK18zY78JYNzftnJgbsm7JhT0uL1E/view?usp=sharing).  Unfortunately I don't have a startup 'before i installed any sound deadening' video, or a 'before w/ o.e.m parts pulling shot' but at least you get to hear the difference with the startup.  

I measured the difference at startup with a sound meter app on my phone, measured approximately 1m away from the machine.  The difference? Approximately a full 7db!  

To embark on this project, you should feel confident with your tinkering abilities, have a tool box and know how to use your tools including teflon tape.

For background info my parents don‚Äôt really care to know how to use the machine properly and tend to just pile a random amount of pre-ground coffee into it and hope for the best so my suspicions are that the portafilter baskets are clogged beyond repair as everything about the machine seems okay up to that point.

Those are you who own this machine combo what are your solutions? Are you pulling 1:2.5+ shots? Are you cramming in >19 grams into the stock basket? Are you just outright avoiding light roast beans? Can you actually pull a 1:2 shot around 30 seconds with light roasts with this set up? "

Purchased at Coffee Addicts in Calgary, AB. Canada. Delivered within days.

My first thoughts are:

1. It's very fast. (83mm burrs vs 50mm?

2. Love the magnetic cup

3. Don't need to RDT and don't see much retention at all. Pumping the bellows is mostly unnecessary.

I thought the first thing I'd like to experiment with was the variable motor speed, as I had read that some people don't agree that it makes much of a difference. Welp...

My first shot was at 800rpm and I got it dialed in with this speed. Then I did one at 300rpm. That drink tasted much thinner. I'm using average quality beans (Kicking Horse Medium roast from Costco) so I don't expect to find a lot of subtle tasting notes in my cup here. Then I put it to 1200rpm and O.M.G. I think I sprayed the entire kitchen. I think there was more channeling than actual pour. I tightened up the grind and did some more experimenting.

So far, it's hard to get a good, non-channeling pour at 1200rpm no matter how much WDT I do. Note that this was never an issue with my Silenzio. 

Maybe there is too much randomness when the grinder is new but I'm still getting a lot of channeling if I raise up the speed (higher speed is supposed to produce a wider grinds profile: good for milk drinks with thick body). "

I saw and read about the OEO portafilter (54mm) and I'm wondering if I should replace it with another one.

I am new to this so please bare with me! 

I want one with ""classic"" spouts, but at first I would like to use the OEM baskets (comes with 2 single walled and 2 double walled baskets (single and double shots each). Is this possible ? I want to start my journey using the double walled filters, and then move to the single walled ones. Later I would probably upgrade the filter baskets.

With my current automatic machine, I mostly make one cup at a time (single or double espresso) when I have guests I usually make 2 cups at a time.

I read that the OEM portafilter generates more pressure and that some people that got another portafilter were having issues with it extracting too fast, compared to the original. Has anyone had this issue?

I have looked at various portafilters, for example:

1. Normcore's [double spout](https://www.normcorewares.com/products/normcore-double-spout-portafilter-with-anodized-aluminum-handle)
2. Normcore's [3-in-1](https://www.normcorewares.com/products/normcore-3-in-1-portafilter-with-handle)
3. Crema's [Bottomless](https://cremacoffeeproducts.com/collections/tools-for-breville/products/bottomless-portafilter) with the [Bottomless Spouts](https://cremacoffeeproducts.com/collections/tools-for-breville/products/bottomless-spouts) addon
4. Pesado 585's [Hybrid](https://pesado585.com/collections/portafilter/products/hybrid-breville-54-58-portafilter)
5. Lastaforest [double spout](https://lastaforest.com/products/54mm-double-spouts-portafilter-fits-breville-sage-barista-express?variant=48223403802857)
6. Sage/Breville [Barista Express' OEM portafilter ](https://www.sageappliances.com/en-gb/product/sp0027237?sku=SP0027237)

and many other brands/models.

I liked the Normcore 3-in-1 concept (item 2. above), as it allows me to use a single or a double spout, and when I ""graduate"" up I could use it bottomless, but I read some users have issues with the non-Normcore baskets popping out and some have had the part that holds the spout(s) to the portafilter pop off with the pressure and destroy the cups below it. Anyone had theae issues?

I read that Crema's version (item 3. above) seems to be a hit or miss for the fit, seems strange a company would do that buy maybe the users got the wrong size or something? Anyone had this issue?

Pesado 585's version (item 4. above) seems wonderfully engineered, but it is expensive and has only a double spout addon (so I'm thinking I might as well get a normal double spout portafilter and upgrade later to a bottomless), plus it is hard to get in Europe.

I read that some people were using the Sage/Breville Barista Express portafilter (item 6. above) with the Bambino Plus, and were happy with it/had no issues. I just wonder why Sage/Breville doesn't list it as compatible if it is compatible? I wonder if the portafilter ears are thicker maybe and this will grind my machine's brew group's bayonet fittings with time?

I don't know much about items 1 and 5 above (if they would work with the original single and double walled Aage/Breville filter baskets). I am open to other suggestions. I am not looking for Temu/Alibaba stuff however, only quality items from reputable brands.

Thank you!

As the title states I‚Äôm a DIY-er with a problem that hopefully is just a rookie mistake someone more experienced will spot straight away.

Minor backstory, I picked up an older La Cimbali from marketplace and gave it a refresh.

- opened, descaled and resealed the boiler with a new gasket
- replaced the group head/portafilter gasket
- replaced shower disk (brass)
- replaced shower screen
- replaced all flexible water pipes
- tested electronics
- powdercoated body

I am very pleased with how this came out aesthetically and am excited to use this machine.


The problem:


I will fill the water reservoir, and prime the boiler by ‚Äúbumping‚Äù the pump. I can then run the pump and will have water flow through the portafilter seemingly normally.

Then upon stopping the pump, when the boiler element turns on to reach temperature, I have more or less constant steam and water flow through the group head/portafilter until the boiler is seemingly empty.

I suspect a stuck valve(?) or maybe an internal one-way-valve or diaphragm but I don‚Äôt really know enough about the intended operation of this machine to say for sure.


Fault finding so far:


- Solenoid valves seem to be operating normally, the steam wand solenoid makes a very discernable click as it actuates which the other one does not but I have swapped the coils between the two and it has made no change in operation.
- I am confident in the boiler seal between halves. I have not yet split the boiler again to investigate internally as I‚Äôd rather not risk ruining the gasket unless absolutely necessary.

Where have I gone wrong? Thank you in advance for any advice"

ü´ò Looking for a new automatic espresso machine (not pod-based, I want to use my own beans)
ü´ò I‚Äôd love something that grinds and brews with minimal daily effort

ü´ò Not trying to drop $6k, but I‚Äôm okay investing in something decent that‚Äôll last 3 to 5 years like my last one

ü´ò Not into Nespresso (but if you‚Äôre a diehard and want to convert me, fine, I‚Äôll listen)

Mainly need it to be an espresso machine, would prefer automatic. 

If you‚Äôve bought a machine you love or know where to shop for one locally (Seattle WA), please send recs. I‚Äôve heard of Seattle Coffee Gear, anyone been?

Thanks in advance from one tired, caffeine-deprived Seattleite."

I‚Äôve narrowed it down to two options: the Breville Dual Boiler or the Barista Touch Impress.

For some context: my partner and I both work from home, and we each drink at least two cups of coffee a day. I usually go for lattes, while she prefers her coffee black.

On one hand, I like the idea of a semi-automatic machine that doesn‚Äôt require constant tweaking to get a good cup (I value convenience and practicality). On the other hand, I know that pairing the Dual Boiler with a good grinder (I‚Äôm considering the DF64 V2) would likely produce better coffee, though it comes with a learning curve.

Here in Australia, both setups cost about the same, and I know many people in this sub would lean toward the Dual Boiler and separate grinder over an all-in-one machine. That said, I‚Äôm really curious to hear from enthusiasts who also value convenience. What would you recommend?

If there are any other options around the same price point that strike a better balance between quality and ease of use, I‚Äôm open to suggestions.

Questions about the grinder:

Here I am between two very different styles:

‚úÖ Eureka Atom W65: with integrated scale, very convenient to weigh on the go if I always use the same coffee.

‚úÖ Eureka Mignon Single Dose Pro: more oriented towards single dose to change grains with ease and less retention.

I'm not sure if the convenience of weighing with the Atom is more worth it or the versatility of a pure single dose to try different coffees.

If anyone has these machines or grinders, I would greatly appreciate knowing:
	‚Ä¢ Daily use experience.
	‚Ä¢ Maintenance and real heating times.
	‚Ä¢ Opinion on the machine + grinder combination that would best fit.

I just bought a Gaggia Classic E24, my first espresso machine, and just had a few general questions.

1. Whenever I make espresso, i notice a tiny bit of grounds still left on the thing that disperses water into the portafilter. It's a little bit hard to clean so I'm just curious if I'm just not tamping the grounds enough or if there is a recommended way to clean it.
2. What exactly is the ideal extraction time? I'm doing 5-7 sec of pre-infusion, my total time usually come around to about 25-28 seconds for 40g of espresso.
3. How can I improve overall espresso, objectively, i feel like I'm below my own bar.

FYI my workflow (using Chestnut C3 grinder, stock double shot filter) is

1 - Let machine warmup 10 min  
2 - Grind set to level 8 (very fine)  
3 - Heat up cups and portafilter  
4 - Open the valve to Pre-infuse for 5-7 seconds, start the espresso  
5 - Close the valve, espresso starts to come out, turn it off after 40g of espresso is out

what i notice is that the espresso comes out tasting a bit harsh, a bit burnt. Should i use a slighlty coarser grind? I'm also noticing a tiny bit of grounds actually make it to the espresso itself.

Also how does extraction time relate to quality of the espresso itself?

Any additional tips appreciated! keep in mind i've brewed only 6-7 shots so far :D"

Hello folks,

I‚Äôm new here‚Äîand new to the espresso hobby as well! My wife recently gifted me a De‚ÄôLonghi EC900M after my old coffee machine gave out.

This is my first time using a proper espresso machine, and I‚Äôve been diving into YouTube videos and guides to learn more about the process of making great espresso.

I have a quick question for the group: I‚Äôm thinking of trying a bottomless portafilter with this machine. Can anyone recommend one that fits the EC900M specifically?

There‚Äôs a lot of information out there‚Äîreviews, videos, etc.‚Äîbut the feedback seems all over the place when it comes to quality, fit, and compatibility. The Normcore 51mm seems to be a leading contender, but I‚Äôd love to hear from people who actually own the EC900M and have tried different brands.

Thanks so much‚ÄîI look forward to learning from you all!

Best regards, MAC"

[Budget: up to $3500],u/haltingpoint,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ltakx3/updating_from_a_silvia_is_lelit_elizabeth_where/,"The Silvia was my entry machine. I am ready to upgrade. I mostly make one milk drink a day, a few times a year I need to make back to back drinks for guests. I want a PID and like a lot of what the Elizabeth has to offer, and Lance Hedrick's recent tier video has it as his top pick for that class. However he has not released his next higher tier video. I am not going to be spending much time messing with manual flow and pressure changes day to day once I get it to some settings I like as most of that is lost in milk anyway.

The main things making me question the Elizabeth are: 

* It's ugly, especially for that price. 

* The steam knob... Seriously WTF were they thinking? I guess I can replace it with wood, though I'd really like a lever

* No ability to plumb it

I realize I'm getting hung up on looks, but for 4 figures it should look a bit nicer.

Is there anything better I should be considering that has a comparable mix of features and looks a bit nicer?"

A few things to think of:
1. I personally drink iced lattes majority of the time. I do love a hot latte here and there. My husband doesn‚Äôt love my nespresso but would be open to drinking americanos if we had a better setup. 
2. I love how quick and easy the nespresso is. I have two young kids and work full time so my mornings are already rushed. Ideally my next machine is easy/relatively quick to use after some trial and error. 
3. we are wanting to get away from the nespresso due to the pod materials and machine materials. Trying to limit plastic exposure and the aluminum from the pods. I recognize that most machines will likely have some plastic, but trying to limit the amount that hot liquid is touching. 
4. from what I‚Äôm reading, a separate grinder is preferred but I am hesitant considering point 2. Not sure if it would take more time but that is a concern 

Basically a great beginner machine transitioning from nespresso while keeping things easy and making a good espresso. 

A few I have looked at: 
- Breville Barista express 
- Ninja Cafe luxe (concerned with this as ninja just makes a bunch of appliances)
- Breville Bambino with separate Grinder
- Gaggia?

I know Amazon is having their prime deals soon and not sure if there will be anything great. Budget listed but if there is something that is still within quality of this range but better priced that is fine too. 

Appreciate the help!

I‚Äôve been working on a free¬†[iOS app called Dial In](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dial-in-coffee/id6746680844), designed to help you log and improve your espresso shots ‚Äî and I‚Äôd love your feedback.

Let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî if you‚Äôre the type who tracks preinfusion to the tenth of a second or distinguishes between inner and outer burr settings, this app¬†*doesn‚Äôt*¬†yet cover all your bases. I expect to get roasted for that, and that‚Äôs fine. That‚Äôs partly why I‚Äôm here.

But here‚Äôs what¬†**Dial In**¬†*does*¬†offer right now:

‚úÖ Quick shot logging (dose, yield, time, grinder setting, notes)  
‚úÖ Instant feedback based on traditional brew ratios or your personal history  
‚úÖ Easy tracking of how your shots evolve across beans, grinders, and days  
‚úÖ A lightweight UI built for speed ‚Äî no accounts or clunky onboarding

What makes it different from other apps:

‚Ä¢ A lot of the current tools either feel dated, require full barista-level knowledge to even get started, or overload you with unnecessary features.  
‚Ä¢ Dial In is designed for people in the middle zone ‚Äî beyond beginner, not quite home roast god ‚Äî who want to improve with less friction.  
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs mobile-first, minimalist, and works out of the box ‚Äî no integrations or fancy gear required.

What‚Äôs coming soon:

üîú Preinfusion and pressure profiling support  
üîú Multi-device syncing + export  
üîú A beginner walkthrough to help folks new to espresso avoid overwhelm  
üîú Latte art analysis + guidance using your camera  
üîú Community features (sharing shot logs, comparing extractions, etc.)

Would love your feedback ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis sucks, just use a notebook‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis could actually help me dial in faster.‚Äù I‚Äôm not trying to sell anything (it‚Äôs 100% free), just hoping to make it better with input from people who actually care about espresso.

Here‚Äôs the¬†[App Store link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dial-in-coffee/id6746680844)¬†if you‚Äôre on iOS and want to try it.

Thanks in advance ‚Äî excited (and nervous) to hear what you think."

I don't like the idea of temperature surfing, (Bambino and othe rno PIDs?), but maybe I should put my time in and learn to do that?

Hi everyone,

I have yet to make my own espresso at home due to some dilemma.. 

I just recently purchased a Breville Bambino Plus +  Shardor Anti-Static Burr Coffee Grinder(not sure if I'll get demolished here for initially buying this one..), and a Kingrinder K6 on the way as my first setup. 

Just recently found out that this rabbit hole branches into further rabbit holes, specifically with the water we use for the espresso machines..

I am in Angus, near around Barrie, Ontario where we seem to have hard water, is it really bad to use tap water as first cycle and for regular use making espresso with my Bambino? 

I've read some posts that Brita filters do nothing to soften the water and most use RO filtration system for their water and remineralize them again to avoid corrosion of the machine over time? 

Is it really worth doing all that than just having my descaling maintenance more frequently by just using hard tap water?

Thank you so much in advance!

Regarding the single-dose tubes for bean storage, I've got a whiskey advent calendar from a couple years back.  They've all been cleaned and retain no smell.  One tube holds 17-19g of beans.  It passes a basic airtightness test by submerging it in water and looking for bubbles.  24 little tubes happen to be exactly enough to store 1 lb. of beans.  What am I not thinking about?

I started with a proper grinder given the one I had was literally garbage. Then I moved into smaller accessories like portafilter, filter, WDT etc. I kept my entry level Delonghi Dedica because it was fine but the idea was to ultimately upgrade to a professional machine.

Fast forward 6+ months, my espresso mania faded a bit and at this point I lost interest in researching, tweaking my technique and spend unnecessary (for me) time to brew a cup of espresso. I also don't like the clutter that all this accessories create on my counter.

So as of now I'm leaning more towards upgrading to an all in one machine (like Delonghi, Breville) that grind, brew and have a milk frother. Given I'm going to have to spend probably around $1000, are those any good or garbage? Any other brands I should consider?

My goal is to have a good looking machine, cut down on the clutter, and brew espresso/cappuccino in a quick and easy way.

Please recommend to me an espresso machine that I will use daily to pull at least 1 cup of espresso. I have previously owned a Breville dual boiler before (and hated the look), so I will pass on Breville this time.

I used to work as a part-time barista before, so guess it is safe to say I am not an amateur. My budget will be $1000 to $3000 AUD, so thats roughly about $600 to 2000 usd?

I don't need a steam wand, I will use it for Americano and espresso only, though I don't mind if the machine has one.

My current grinder is Eureka Mignon Specialita, not my favourite, but my budget is towards the espresso machine. I can upgrade the grinder accordingly (please do recommend grinders too for espresso). I don't need a grinder to do pour-overs, my c40 is gonna last another few years, I guess."

The take: I would like a setup that could last me a while not breaking my bank balance.

Grinder options:
Baratza Encore ESP 160‚Ç¨ - wary of noise levels and mess.
Fellow Opus 160‚Ç¨ - internal adjustment seems like a hassle
Mignon manuelle 230‚Ç¨ - In a review I heard it is mainly a dark roast grinder, it this true?
(Optional) DF54 very hard to get in CZ but willing to listen to users 

I like the design of Fellow, or the Metal body of the Mignon yet most people recommend the ESP. Even though to my eye the inside of the grinder looks exactly like the Fellow. I heard that mignons are more expensive everywhere else in the world and still recommended so that drew me there.

Onto the machine:
Lelit anna 440‚Ç¨- love the look and specs of the machine but 57mm portafilter makes me secons guess the decision.
Gagia classic e24 400‚Ç¨- I am not sure the modability is something I will use
Sage/Bambino+ 380‚Ç¨- GF says it looks ‚Äúplasticky‚Äù
Hibrew10A - 160‚Ç¨ non solenoid valve option that has been recommended by a friend, I am not sure a machine without the solenoid is worth it.

I would jump straight for the Lelit if it had a standard portafilter, but the 57mm makes me look at other machines. It is not such a big deal? Gagia looks solid but most people recommens it for its modability down the line. The Bambino seems like a crowd pleaser but doesn‚Äôt have the charm of the orher machines.

I am open to suggestions and advice from users and coffee nerds on chosing a combo.

TLDR: would Lelit anna and Mignon Manuelle be a good setup that lasts a while? Are the negatives I listed really present?

Been slowly redoing everything in the house and replacing stuff in the kitchen with BFL pieces of equipment because I spend a ton of time cooking and it simply makes me happy. Now that I am slowly moving to appliances I'm considering replacing my Gaggia. I've owned it for about 5/6 years, installed a couple of mods including a PID and while I have been enjoying the machine, I often encounter consistency problems. Same grind, same beans, same prep, different results. The machine is flushed weekly and cleaned, soaked (caffizza) and descaled once a month or more if needed. It works great, let's just say that I would like to think about moving towards something nicer! 
My wife also has zero interest in coffee prep which means that I have to find a setup that can be as easy as dumping the ground from the grinder to the portafilter, tamp and go. She can't be asked learning or remembering any of the other things which also means that the more consistent the machine is from a baseline perspective, the better! 
Oh and the grinder is a Sculptor 64S that I grabbed when it was cheap on kickstarter at the time. 

Now for the coffees. We use beans from a local roaster here in New Zealand and you'd probably call the roast depth medium. I only make black coffees, I take mine short and my wife takes hers long with a dash of milk, no steaming required really. We're talking two coffees a day or sometimes four if I don't want my second cup to be a pour over (but that's rare). And of course there's the occasion when we have guests and I have to pull a few more shots in a row but that's not the main use of the machine. 

At this point I'm very open to ideas and suggestions really. I'm still going to use my chemex in addition to the espresso machine too for added variety. But as the title says and with the little blurb above, I would love to hear some of your suggestions! "

Hey everyone, just like countless other people I have also gone down this rabbit hole. I‚Äôm looking to purchase my first espresso machine.   I‚Äôm currently considering either the Ninja luxe cafe premier or the bambino plus + Df54 grinder.

Now some much needed context:

1. I‚Äôm not a coffee/espresso snob at all, by all means, I think i don‚Äôt even know what good coffee is. I mostly enjoy drinking iced lattes from local coffee shops. And that‚Äôs probably what i‚Äôm going to be using the machine to make, some hot lattes here and there in winter.

2. The whole idea of crafting a quality espresso seems really cool and interesting but in reality I‚Äôm not looking for a new hobby. what i‚Äôm looking for is making really good drinks at home. And even if i was getting into the hobby, i don‚Äôt think the rest of my family would be too keen on the learning curve.

3. I‚Äôm always looking to get the best value /

I‚Äôm currently exploring upgrading my Bambino that I‚Äôve had for about 3 years now. I make 2-4 drinks a day. Usually an espresso for myself and cortado for my wife.

My wife tends to stay in the medium-dark roast range.
I want more control over temp to venture into lighter roasted coffees.

I currently have a DF54 grinder as well as a JX-Pro. 

I‚Äôm kind of lost on where to go from here. The value and convenience is amazing from the bambino and honestly there‚Äôs no real complaints besides the temp control. 

Would it make sense to just go for a gaggia with pid and gaggimate/gaggiuno? I would also entertain the idea of a lever machine since I will be the only one drinking lighter roasts.

Would love to hear the thoughts.

I am looking at buying a used espresso machine and have found two options locally that seem appealing.

There is a La Cimbali M21 Junior that seems to have been well kept with filtered water and regular yearly maintenance for $1250

There is a Lelit Glenda with PID that seems to be in good shape for $475. I‚Äôm not familiar with this machine other than what I‚Äôve read here. 

I have professional experience running a La Cimbali M29 Selectron, so there is something appealing about going back to being spoiled with a commercial machine, especially something so similar to what I‚Äôve used in the past. However at triple the cost, I figured I would ask and see what folks thought between those two options.

I‚Äôm also working getting an espresso grinder, perhaps turning a Bunn g3 into a  Bunzilla, perhaps a buying a La San Marco or a DF54. Thats something I‚Äôll have to resolve, and should have the budget for with whichever way I decide on the machine.

Would love to hear thoughts and opinions on both machines, especially if you have experience with owning, running, or servicing one or both.

Hi I am thinking about moving from my (broken, after 3 years already!) Delonghi la sepcialist maestro (yeah roast me) to an upgrade. I need to consider a few things

    99% i only drink coffee in the morning, foamed milk and different types of infusion and a few times an espresso

    using very dark spanish/portugese roasts mostly

    i am a bit stressed in the morning, faster getting a coffee is better

    it needs to be optically acceptable to my partner (bianca with stainless and wood is)

    should not be very loud

As the bianca does not have a grinder, i am looking for a suitable grinder, too. And a table to place it on, that fits the machine (not that I would personally care but...)

So, vast knowledge of the Espresso world, what would be good for someone used to push buttons in the morning but is willing to learn and extend the knowledge to another world?

Any recommendations?

I'll give a bit of background to my set up and the issue I have. I purchased an ECP31.21 about 5 years ago and lived with the quality that came from the pressurised basket up until about 4 months ago.

I found a refurbed Baratza Encore for a good price so took the plunge; along with a Chinesium open bottom portafilter, dosing funnel and WDT (I couldn't find a compatible 2 ear 51mm portafilter that wasn't painfully expensive for someone just starting out).

Following this I went through the process of dialing in my grind size. I started with a underextracted shot and incrementally decreased my grind size until I could literally go no further on the Encore. I even took the cover off to adjust the screw adjustment underneath to the finest point.

The flavour was getting there, with what I feel is a good extraction, but it was sending jets all over the place. Even with the grinds distributed to within an inch of their lives it still happened. All the holes on the portafilter are open and uniform and I use a 15g dose.

Two months into using the HiBREW setup, I gave it everything I had (well, not everything, but quite a bit) and bought a used Expobar Office Pulser.

Interestingly, the machine was barely used ‚Äî in three years, it made fewer than 30 shots, which was clearly reflected in its condition. The grinder, too, had only gone through about 1‚Äì2 kg of coffee.

1,2025-07-07,Some observations of mine when dialing in my shot (Casabrews cm5418 + Kingrinder K6),u/Tim_L_09101,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lu8qoi/some_observations_of_mine_when_dialing_in_my_shot/,"Was contemplating whether to use the dialing help flair because this is mainly just me sharing some of the things I have gone through trying to figure out why my shot wasn't working with those who may find this helpful. Now I've successfully gotten to a good daily driver, I'm not really looking to change it or experiment with new things anytime soon.

Also let me start my saying that what I'm sharing here is not a well-controlled experiment, as I often changed more than one variables from run to run. Also the only adjustments available to me were grind size and dosage, as the machine I'm using does not have a temperature or flow rate control. 

So I started my espresso adventure using the same stule of beans that I have been using for French press and Aeropress brewing, which is generally some form of medium-roast that don't present a lot of acidity using the aforementioned brewing methods. Long story short, this style of beans just never worked for me on my espresso setup. 

Conventional espresso wisdom says the shot would undergo a transition from underextraction to overexteaction depending on grind size. However this was not observed in my scenario. What I've seen using my setup can probably be best summed up as a transition between a less intense flavor profile and a more intense flavor profile that has more or less the same notes. Basically, I would go from a watery shot with less unpleasant flavors to a beautiful, syrupy shot that are incredibly sour and unpleasant. I was actually never able to reach the transition point talked about in most espresso literature where the shot starts to get bitter/overextracted, before the pressure goes off the chart and basically no flow.

So I decided to switch to a darker roast to see if it would at least resolve the acidity problem, and it DID! A little caveat though is I have also made progress in my puck prep by modding my WDT tool to have much wider-spaced needles to, well, actually function as intended (I told you how this is not a great experiment). 
Nevertheless, I am now able to pull a shot with good consistency and not overly bitter/ashy like what I'd get at Starbucks.

For anyone who might find this helpful, I am using 14g of fishermen's blend frim cutters point coffee (local roaster in Seattle area), 41 clicks on the K6, generic bottomless portafilter and a diowood puck screen. I usually target a final shot between 30 and 35g, manually stopping flow 5g before the target. "

I currently have a Breville Infuser. I think that it has served well as a starter-machine for me. My main complaints are is that:

- It is old and starting to look that way
- The 54mm portafilter isn't really standard size so I have to use a funnel
- It seems like it pushes water through at too high a pressure, resulting in poor
extraction. I have tried adjusting my grind size, but then the machine simply
chokes and can't push anything through.

My normal routine is 1 to 2 milk drinks per day. Possibly a third if my wife decides that she wants one. The drinks are probably 10-15 minutes apart in time or more. Rarely, I will drink just espresso.

In my initial search, the next step up seemed like a dual boiler machine. However, after reading many posts here, it sounds like the additional price might not fit my use case. I read several posts that amounted to ""why are you replacing your B. Infuser?"" since it might do everything that I need already. So, while I'm open to the idea of a DB, it sounds like a good single boiler might be the end-game machine for me.

Wants:
- Machine that fits my use case
- 1800 watt maximum power draw
- It should be safe long-term. (something about lead content in certain boiler materials?)
- 58mm portafilter
- Capable of making great espresso
- No major design flaws that the community hates

Machines that I have considered through my review of literature here:

- Profitec Go
- Ascaso Steel Uno

I appreciate the community's help and input here."

I dont plan to go deeper into a hole.

I decided to go with eureka specialita and I wanted sage dual boiler as it has 58mm PF and a lot of options, but I looked at dimensions and with size bigger than touch impress and separate grinder, it takes all table space I have in my kitchen. I started thinking about something smaller for temporary time, in that case I dont want spend a lot. I have few accessories for 54 PF, so currently considering only 54 or 58mm. I found bambino plus for 322eur in sea salt color, looks as a good deal, except that I am not sure if I will be happy with this machine.

More info about touch impress: At first it was nice, then I found grinder(baratza) is struggling with a lot of beans even medium, and as I was trying to improve my brew, I started to hate intelligent dialin and dosing, hot water flow, tamper has small diameter for 3rd baskets, automilq does not give good results with low fat milk.

Me and my girlfriend (who is willing to tolerate my espresso hobby) are drinking mostly cappuccino/lattes. When we have family over, they mostly drink normal coffee (so americano with an espresso machine?).

So normal usage will be 2 coffees after each other for me and my girlfriend, when family is over it could be 4-6 americanos/cappuccino/lattes.

So Dual Boiler/HX is the way to go, as far as i have researched.

I fear the Mara X is a little too manual for my gf, how is your experience?

  
I am planning to get a DF64 grinder to go with any of the machines.

I'm open to other suggestions as the 3 models i listed, if you have any recommendations"

Ground a few shots with it and the level of grind quality in comparison to my Sage Barista Express is instantly noticeable. I saw online that some people say a kg of coffee should be ground through it to break it in?

I'm based in the Republic of Ireland and I found it tough to locate a seller based in Europe with it in stock to avoid import charges. I had to purchase on Amazon last Thursday and arrived today from https://amzn.eu/d/09XXB10

Cost was 309 euro and the seller also refunded me the import tax which came to 12 euro.

Really impressed with the whole experience from the buyer and looking forward to many tasty shots from it.

138,2025-07-08,Displaying Coffee Bags / Decorating the Coffee Station (DIY),u/example42,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1luqb0b/displaying_coffee_bags_decorating_the_coffee/,"Hopefully this is of some interest to the group and may inspire others....

I find the variety of art and design on coffee bags to be enchanting. I decided to save my coffee bags for 2024 and at the end of the year created a framed ""best of 2024"" art piece to hang next to my station. Here's the result.

It's 14 framed bags, all consumed in 2024. It captures some local roasters, some bags picked up while traveling, and some from Trade (coffee subscription service). If you're looking to do something like this yourself, here's how I did it and some tips.

* I used an inexpensive IKEA frame. I believe it's a 24""x36"" LOMVIKEN frame, though it appears they don't make that size in gold anymore. The LOMVIKEN or R√ñDALM frames will be your best best if you're looking for the larger sizes, but YMMV. You could also pick up cheap frames at Goodwill / second hand stores or craft stores like Michael's.
* I rough cut the back of the bags off using scissors. I tried to not touch / remove any of the edge of the bags to make mounting as easy as possible.
* I measured and recorded the length and width of the face of each bag that I wanted visible. I made sure to leave at least a few MM around each corner for mounting.
* I spent an hour on the kitchen table laying out the bags in different orders / configurations to see what I liked. This game me the rough layout based on frame dimensions, bag design, bag size, etc.
* At this point I realized that it was going to be a pain to get the exact cuts / dimensions for each window by hand, so I decided to use CAD (Fusion 360) to do a layout. I'm a CAD newbie with minimal experience. I had just started to teach myself for a 3d printing project. Working on a 2d layout proved easy and a great learning project. It allowed me to get the spacing perfect between bags and rows and make sure everything was aligned.
* I ordered some uncut matboard online and a mat cutter. Long story short, don't bother. Cutting such precise windows without any mistakes was about four orders of magnitude beyond my abilities.
* Turns out there's lots of online shops that will make custom matboards for you. I used Matboard Plus. They had a simple online tool where you could ""draw"" your windows. It was easy to transfer the cuts/dimensions from my CAD drawing into their online tool.
* When the matboard arrived, one at a time I centered each bag in the appropriate window (from behind) and used small pieces of mounting tape to secure the edges and corners of the back to the back of the matboard.
* Finally, with all the bags framed and centered and their cutouts, I placed the matboard into the frame and mounted it on the wall.
* Total project cost (ignoring my dead ends like a mat cutter and DIY matboard) Was around $125. That's the frame, custom cut matboard, and mounting tape.

I'm an amateur with no framing experience, so let me know if there's anything I can improve on for 2025!"

I have noticed this despite having the same parameters (I.e. tamp twice, wdt, 93 degrees C and 9bar pressure). One thing I did that seems to help is grind a few beans as sacrifice before taking the first shot.

Am I right? Is this standard practice in hopper based grinder to grind a few grams in the morning before taking the first shot ? Am I supposed to waste 0.3-1g of coffee each day in the morning?

First shot: 18 seconds 19.5g in and 40g out Watery consistency

Second shot 29 seconds 19.5g in and 40g out Can taste chocolaty and nutty notes, very good consistency"

I am fairly new to this hobby of home espresso making, and it has become a calming part of my morning routine. However, I also don't plan on going super deep into the hobby, I have been happy with the quality of what I drink now. I used to be a black coffee person, so this is already a huge upgrade!

I have used the Delongi ECP3420 for the last 18 months, using a bottomless portafiler and IMS basket. My wife uses it time to time, but she just uses the pressurized basket it came with and preground coffee.  I recently got Baratza Encore which took my game to the next level. Recently, the ECP has started being extremely inconsistent due to a leak around the PF (a seal broke). This morning it actually bursted from the pressure leakage. Replacing the part would require huge disassembly and repair, which I don't think is worthwhile since I paid $45 for the machine!

My wife is letting me use this opportunity to upgrade. I don't need anything crazy, as I like the simplicity of the current setup (I only make lattes, so...). And I want to keep something that the wife can easily use like she does now. 

Is there a machine that is sub $500 that would upgrade my espresso game while still letting the wife pull simple shots? Or maybe spending $100 for a new shiny ECP be worth it since we know it works for us?

Also, any tips on dialing in a shot of Lavazza Super Crema would be appreciated. Not the best blend I know, but it was on sale and wanted to give it a shot!"

I‚Äôve been on the hunt for an espresso machine for the past 6 months and would love your thoughts on a specific deal I‚Äôm considering.

I check Facebook Marketplace daily, but most used machines are still going for $350‚Äì$500. I usually don‚Äôt mind buying secondhand, but with espresso machines, it feels a bit risky without knowing how well they‚Äôve been maintained.

For context, I‚Äôm currently using a Keurig K-Supreme, but after getting hooked on lattes, it just isn‚Äôt cutting it anymore. Between the rising cost of coffee and how much I enjoy the process, investing in a good machine seems like the right move.

Would really appreciate any input‚Äîespecially from fellow espresso newbies or anyone who‚Äôs been in my shoes. I‚Äôve also been eyeing the Ninja Luxe but don‚Äôt know much about it.

Thanks in advance!"

Since my Breville Bambino and Eureka Mignon had to be transported via cargo, they only just arrived at our new home a few days ago.

I tried increasing the grind size a few times, but that didn‚Äôt help. I also tried reducing it, as shown in the video I'm attaching, but the results have been pretty much the same. The coffee still tastes good, though.

I am in the market for buying a grinder (Canada) and I am wondering about these two:

Mazzer Philos -¬†[https://idrinkcoffee.com/products/mazzer-philos-single-dose-grinder-black-i189d?currency=CAD&stkn=156e885cee45](https://idrinkcoffee.com/products/mazzer-philos-single-dose-grinder-black-i189d?currency=CAD&stkn=156e885cee45)

Lagom P64 -¬†[https://cafune.ca/products/option-o-lagom-p64-flat-burr-grinder?variant=32353520517185&country=CA&currency=CAD](https://cafune.ca/products/option-o-lagom-p64-flat-burr-grinder?variant=32353520517185&country=CA&currency=CAD)

Likely, if I got the Philos, I would just get both burrs but start with the i189s, so that isn't the issue, if I got the p64, likely would try the unimodal and hope they work well for both the light roasts as well as my medium roast/more classic profiles. So I don't want the burr set to be the main differentiator. BUT

For those who have had issues with their grinders (Philos or P64), did you have an easy time with getting it fixed or looked at? I feel like here, the Philos would win because more suppliers carry this grinder.

My burr related Question would be: If you got the Philos, did you move away from the Mazzer burrs? Did the other burrs work as intended?

What in your mind matters more? The auger or adjustable RPM for the beans?

For those who got the Lagom, are you constantly tweaking the RPM? DO you find you know where it works best for your beans? Do you hardly change it?

Do you have buyers remorse with whichever grinder you bought? Which one did you wish you bought in place of it?

Longevity: Philos does seem like a tank, assuming here you won't have an issue.. Did you? How about the Lagom?

Do you think the difference in price is worth it? the Philos is $675 less than the P64? Is the P64 worth the extra money?

I would love everyone's opinion on their use of these two grinders!

should I justs ay F-it and save up more for a Kafatek Monolith Max?

I am currently using a Cafelat Robot, but am Also looking to buy a new espresso machine... potentially either the Profitec Drive (only if it is easy to change the pressure).. or just keep it simple with the Profitec 300.. open to suggestions with dual boilers.. not sure

On stock burrs I was grinding at about a 2-3 on the timemore, and was probably getting more output than needed. Even on 5 now with the SSP burrs the grinds feel very fine and I am over extracting (I hope this is the right one), with water left on top of the puck after, and less than a 1:2 ratio (I used to be getting more like 1:3.5 or even 1:4 on stock burrs, but I was using 17g as a standard dose). It seems like I need to go coarser, but the fact that I am way past the ""espresso"" range of the timemore is freaking me out a little bit. It's entirely possible I need to just get over myself and put the dial where it needs to be to get coarser coffee, but I'd like to know. I set the zero point on the timemore right to where the burr chirp is, so I know zero really does mean zero. 

The shots don't taste *bad* necessarily, I would say they're probably on the more bitter side, certainly not sour. It's very hard to find help because everyones setup is so unique to them.

I don't really ever plan on making drip coffee, so if I need to dial it up, that's okay with me.

  
It does feel like even 18g sits a little low in the portafilter, like maybe I should be trying 19 or even 20? I know you're supposed to change 1 variable at a time but I'm really not sure which to go with. Any help is greatly appreciated and I welcome any advice anyone may have!"

I just got a job as a barista a couple weeks ago! I‚Äôve never had a coffee maker or been a barista before but I‚Äôve always loved drinking good coffee and have been wanting to buy a home machine for years, but had no clue where to start.

Now after being professionally trained in pulling shots and steaming milk, and after doing some research I definitely want a machine that allows me to steam my own milk and have a more manual than automated experience so I can practice at home.

I want to practice steaming milk manually.

I was looking at the Breville barista pro or express impress instead and could cover the difference, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to pay more than $200 myself, or $700 for a machine total.

I‚Äôm not tied to Breville or anything, just was looking at that because it‚Äôs the same brand he was looking at.

[budget approx US $600],u/colin-mac,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lv7j1z/sculptor_64s_vs_lagom_casa_budget_approx_us_600/,"Hi - I'm on the fence between the Sculptor 64s and the Lagom Casa. I'll be using the grinder with mostly medium to dark beans for both filter and pour overs (Moccamaster and Switch) or expressos (Profitec Go), with the split between the former and latter at about 50/50. Also, about 75/25 for straight vs milk-based espressos.

I wouldn't plan to change the burrs ‚Äî heard that it's a cumbersome process on the Sculptor and my palate isn't refined enough to appreciate the differences between flat and conical burrs or different burr sets ‚Äî but I would like the cleaning process to be quick and easy.

I'm somewhat concerned about the Casa's dial-adjustment system and the related need to do multiple rotations when switching from fine to much coarser settings.

Build quality is very important to me, as is the ability to self-service, because among the many good things of living in Hawaii, ready access to repair facilities is not one.

Any suggestions that could help push me in one direction or the other?"

Ideally I would like to replace both my grinders with one. I know there are iterations of this question that always come up from time to time so I appreciate any insight.

Currently:  
\- 1 to 3 espresso shots daily plus a flat white every other day  
\- filter coffee every other day (orea, aeropress or switch)  
\- I primarily drink specialty light roast (Dak, Fried Hats, Sey, Onyx, Manhattan, ONA ..typical fanboy stuff) and occasionally will dip into something a little bit darker like The Barn espresso roasts that are light medium or so  
\- I enjoy experimenting with flow control, compound chilling, turbos, and other ECJ favourites approved by my wife's bf  
\- currently using DF64 with SSP high uniformity and ODE gen 1 with SSP MP for filter brews

EG1  
\- this grinder will replace both grinders  
\- love the build quality and aesthetic  
\- a little slower than I would like but ok as it will do espresso and filter  
\- personal opinion but I am not crazy about the grinding sound (maybe its different in person?)  
\- a little concerned about the stalling at low rpm but seems to be mixed opinions about this  
\- will be going for the Core burr option  
\- don't mind the idea of using the shaker, but I prefer straight to portafilter  
\- digital rpm display  
\- costs more than 01

Lagom 01  
\- the speed is appealing, even at low rpm it grinds fast  
\- I like the aesthetic, but the EG1 edges it out slightly  
\- better grind to portafilter option  
\- 102 mizen blind burr would be the choice  
\- cheaper option  
\- rpm isn't as accurate based on the dial vs digital display of EG1  
\- I prefer the sound of this grinder personally

I would be particularly interested in hearing from those who use the Lagom for espresso and filter, open to other suggestions (DF83v was considered but I cannot unsee the train look), I would still consider the Monolith but currently out of the running because I wouldn't consider it for filter (at least that is what I gather from the videos I've watched)

Thanks in advance!"

A skill, a grinder, or a coffee?",u/Lowstradamus,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lv9kej/what_am_i_looking_for_a_skill_a_grinder_or_a/,"My wife and I have been pulling shots for lattes and cortados about 10 years now. Started with a Breville infuser and bodum grinder. Stepped up to a Sette 270 after about 2 years. Then at 5 years we graduated machines to a Profitec Pro 700. Around the same time we added a Niche Zero alongside the Sette for pourover and decaf single dosing. Eventually we just turned the Niche into our daily grinder for everything. We have gotten to the point of where we feel like we are wanting more from our coffee; more nuance or something that we get from our good local coffee shops when we stop in, but we can't reproduce at home.

We have tried getting bags of what the shops are brewing and dialing them in at home. The ratios and timing that the shop tells us get dialed in well and repeatable, but there just doesn't seem like there is anything exciting in the cup. Tried some Proud Mary light roasts, everything got lost in the milk to where it just tasted like steamed milk in a cup with leftover coffee. Tried some Dark Matter and Andytown medium roasts, Mayorgas, Toby's Estate. Medium roasts just come out generic, but at least they have a flavor. So we've been riding the same medium roast for about 7 years now, consistently enjoyable for us, but we would like to get outside of our lines a bit more and experience at home what we experience in shops.

I know for a fact I'm not looking for a new machine. I'm trying to convince myself that I'm not in need of a flat burr grinder, because I'm trying to actively block an upgrade syndrome. So that leaves me to only criticize my technique. Perhaps there is more to hitting the checkboxes and adjusting accordingly, but I have no problem dialing a bag in for 18g:36-42g in 27-36 seconds. We use custom water, WDT, and controlled tamping. So perhaps I'm missing something in the nooks and crannies of technique.

What change did you do one day that you look back on and can point to as the moment your home espresso took a leap?

Or... do I need to get flat burr grinder and go explore; is there enough opportunity there to get us where we want to go?

Thanks to anyone who takes their time to respond."

I live in UAE, here there are way too mamy roasteries, BUT, as a coffee nerd, I am thinking of starting my own beans brand (name and details yet to be thought of). 

*******
Notes: 
** I have around 7k followers on instagram, so there is a small community. 
** No hands on experience in roasting, but I have quite few good connections here with roasteries. 
** I have a budget of $10k to start with. 

*******

The questions:

1- is it feasable to communicate with some roastery to roast the beans, or should I think of a small patch roastery at home?

2- should I start on my own right away or collaborate with some roasteries for commissions? 

3- If I started, should I buy green beans from local suppliers to start with or should I look overseas?

Options I‚Äôm considering are:

I think I would go for the Niche if I didn‚Äôt want to do pour over as well so much.

I think I‚Äôm leaning more towards the DF64v at the moment. I like the look of it and it‚Äôs quite compact. Questions are, are the stock burrs *good enough* for espresso and pour over, and is it a nice, clean, workflow?

I'll also call MiiCoffee later today, I'm on the east coast so it's still a bit early on the west coast. If I get any response from MiiCoffee I'll edit this post.

My plan, for when I have family visiting, is to get a Eureka Libra so they can use that (much easier workflow) with this ECM.  When it is just me and my wife, this is perfect... well, when it is just me and my wife I switch this off and use the Londinium... I really love the coffee/espresso from a lever machine.

I watched tons of videos and assumed my bad technique was due to bad tools. I noticed I could never tamp a perfect level puck and I felt like that‚Äôs why my espresso wasn‚Äôt coming out right. I tried 16g and all the way up to 18g and I think 18g improved my prep a bit. 

I noticed at the bottom of my bambino portafilter, the flow would be uneven. One would be strong flow, other would dribble and vice versa. 

I was keeping the portafilter flat on my counter but for some reason when I eyeball my tamps they don‚Äôt look level and kinda crooked and I try super hard to keep it flat and level

So I bought a wdt tool, funnel, spin distributor thing, and spring loaded tamp tool 

It did improve a little but I still feel like I get uneven tamps. Idk if the bambino portafilter doesn‚Äôt level by itself if I lay it flat on counter but I can‚Äôt figure it out

Does this happen to others too? What am I doing wrong? I assumed when the puck prep is perfect, I should have espresso flow coming out of the bottom of the portafilter equally and both at around the same time.

Wanted to thank Tom‚Äôs YouTube channel and fellow Redditors on this subreddit that made me land on this.
Originally I looked at the Varia VS6 but after reading and seeing so many people have mixed reviews with the QS I decided to go to spend more on this hand built Italian beauty. 
After running approx 2kg of Costco beans I had sitting around I am currently trying to dial in but not sure whether I am not tamping or over tamping which is causing inconsistency with my shots. Beans were roasted on the 25th of June. 

The setup:
It‚Äôs currently set on 21 clicks on the Mazzer Philos with 200d burrs, MH3 Bomber Dex 20g precision basket, Normcore WDT Tool and Normcore V2 Tamp, Breville Dual Boiler.

Process: weigh 20g, comes out 20g after a few knocks and using the tool. Sometimes .2g to .3G off if I don‚Äôt use the tool. Use the WDT and then tamp and boom it goes in machine. Sometimes the bar starts and 11 and sometimes it goes under 9 just ever so slightly and sometimes it‚Äôs perfect pull.

Question is‚Ä¶ is it just my WDT and tamping technique? And should I just get a distribution tool.

Lastly anyone else finding coffee grind sticks to the steel cup when you are emptying into portafilter.

Again this machine is just a beauty and will post a proper review once I have everything down pat (more a me problem then equipment).

Looking at getting a machine for home use. Have had some experince with coffee machines through a cafe at work but nothing serious.

Ive stumbled upon a Breville barista max second hand for ¬£130  (I have seen the distinction between breville and sunbeam in the UK dw) but it has a tempertature issue.Seller says its about 10C colder. This comes with a inbuilt grinder and would just wait for a bit down the line before getting a stand alone one.

The alternative is Breville barista mini and getting a stand alone grinder now. Barista mini is on offer at ¬£135 off of amazon and am unsure on what grinder i would get to go with it.

Are there any machines that are clearly more worthwhile getting that im being blind to or is the second hand machine worthwhile as an entry into home espresso?

And previously had a Giotto Cronometro R for a few years.

I'm having an issue where the steam coming out of it is a bit smelly and I'd like to fix it without having to send the machine off for an expensive full service/descaling and am not sure what to do.

&nbsp;

For the water, I always have used a ZeroWater jug, and then mix according to the baristahustle recipe. Never used tap water. I always backflush 2x at the end of each day and use cafiza once every 3-4 weeks.

I also make sure to purge the steam wand immediately after using it, and yet the steam (and the water from the group head) has a slight musty almost fishy smell to it?

I've thoroughly cleaned the water tank a couple times, and all other equipment, maybe I didn't clean the tank frequently enough initially, but now I'm wondering how to sort this.

&nbsp;

Is it safe to use a vinegar/water mixture to flush through the machine? Should I get a descaling solution instead?
I'd always read that descaling an e61 machine yourself without taking it apart was asking for trouble and really don't want to damage my still relatively new machine.

Anyone got any advice on the best way to give the boiler a bit of a refresh and address the smell?"

What shocked me recently is, that I brought my DF64v grinder (SSP MP) to my friend who just purchased a Lelit Bianca and the first crappy shot was better then my best ever shot on my BDB. Everything was the same, ""just"" the machine was different. Even the water was the same.

I'm quite puzzled, because Lance is praising the BDB pretty highly, but it just seems, something is not working for me. I almost tried everything. Turbo shot, preinfusion only shots, low temp, higher temp, everything.

So my questions are as follows:

1)Is there a burr upgrade out there that anyone would recommend? I know you want the burrs to cut the beans rather than actually crush them as this reduces fines. If there isn't a good upgrade, where could I find new versions of the original? I tried looking for Breville parts on their website but either had bad luck or bad eyes.


2) Have you done this yourself? If so, what resources did you use? He'd like to undertake the project together with me as a kind of bonding thing and I'd like to honor that.


3) Once the burrs are in, is there a tell-tale sign that they're calibrated/shimmed correctly?

Having scrolled through this reddit, I know that many believe no machine can make proper espresso if it's under 200$ and while I do indeed respect that sentiment; I do not have that sort of budge to spend at this moment in time.

I've done some scrolling around on Amazon  and have seen:

* CASABREWS 3700 Essential Espresso Machine (94$)
* AMZCHEF Espresso Machine (85$)
* CHULUX Slim Espresso Machine with Milk Frother Steam Wand (79$)
* De'Longhi Stilosa Manual Espresso Machine (99$)

Though further research on the internet has narrowed it down primarily between the Casabew and De'Longhi. I have also contemplated getting a Moka Pot instead even though I know espresso is a percolation brew and a Moka Pot would be a weak adaption --- due to the Moka's cheapness and flexibility. There is a coffee shop down the street from where I live who will hand grind beans for you so I am thinking of getting my supply there or investing in a ""make do"" grinder.

Just looking for any advice honestly and while I have massive respect for those who do this hobby, I don't have the fund available at this moment in time (Breville is an unattainable dream rn). Thank you in advance!

And that is simply extracting directly over ice cubes.

I am now typically doing 13g in and 42g out (max output of La Pavoni) with the steam PI of La Pavoni engaged for 10s and shot done in another maybe 8s. Trying to keep group at 85c which should give about 93-94c on extraction..

Now I never 100% enjoyed that drink especially compared to doing the same beans as V60 .. just didn't get the same tasting notes or complexity.. all just overpowered by intense acidity. I've tried different things I went away from Niche Zero to Timemore 064s. I have aquited a 49mm mesh basket (kinda poor man's billet...) But nothing really worked for me...

Until I've tried extracting over ice. I get all the notes I was missing compared to the V60. I am not sure if it is just the temperature or the fact that it dilutes the shot further (I can't go beyond 13:42 on LP as that is the volume of the group.. but that being said on 58mm machine I never enjoyed those humongous 20g shots...). I've tried diluting with water - doing long blacks before but the ice cubes are just superior..

Overall I get all the flavour notes (berries..), the sweetness (for those beans that exhibit it) and pleasant not overwhelming acidity with no bitterness.

Anyway I am really excited, I have started to do more V60 an though my La Pavoni will get jealous as a proper Italian and break on me. Now I am churning those iced espressos and really enjoying those..

Anyone has similar observation / taste?

I recently purchased a new to me Expobar Dual Boiler (Office Leva 2004), which was chugging along well for a week but suddenly stopped heating both the brew and steam boilers (as luck would have it).

The pump still works and pulls cold water, and after digging around a little, I think the issue is mainly isolated to the steam boiler which is also affecting the brew boiler as a downstream effect. Also the issue arose after using the steam wand to make three lattes in succession which leads me to believe it could be the culprit.

After testing continuity on the high limit switch using a multimeter (no continuity and no resistance), I think it‚Äôs probably time to replace the original high limit switch since it doesn‚Äôt seem resettable (picture attached).

The issue I‚Äôm facing now is that the steam boiler high limit switch is rated for 140 C, and is proving very difficult to find on the internet (not in the inventory of WLL, espresso parts, or a few international stores). The brew boiler switch is rated for 145 C which is commonly available.

I searched on Amazon and found this product (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0838YVBB7?ref=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apin_dp_HWJTQR1P4XNZ2R332JXR_2&ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apin_dp_HWJTQR1P4XNZ2R332JXR_2&social_share=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apin_dp_HWJTQR1P4XNZ2R332JXR_2&previewDohEventScheduleTesting=C&csmig=1) which is rated for 250V and 10A.

2. if not, can I use a lower (135) or higher limit (145) switch or will it be a safety hazard? And would the experts here recommend getting a manual reset or an auto reset switch?

I‚Äôve narrowed it down to these two machines and I was hoping to get some advice on which to buy. 

I‚Äôm not too interested in modding the GCP straight out of the box. 

The most troubling thing for me is that I‚Äôm not sure if the Profitec Go performs so much better than the E24 GCP to warrant spending ~$600 extra (Profitec Go is $1050, GCP is $450). 

I plan to mainly drink medium roast Americanos, and I‚Äôm not big on milk drinks because I‚Äôm lactose intolerant so steaming isn‚Äôt a huge concern. 

In my use case I think the PID on the Profitec is mainly a consistency thing rather than for experimenting. 


I‚Äôd mainly make coffee for just myself, but occasionally have a couple of guests over. 

Anyone have good experiences with a stock GCP E24? In the enthusiast community it‚Äôs hard to tell if a stock GCP is actually lackluster or if it‚Äôs perfectly satisfactory for the majority of coffee fans. 

I‚Äôve also been thinking that a refurbished Profitec Go is a good middle ground but they seem to be hard to come by.

Bambino Plus - so far, it‚Äôs been great and serves our needs well. Really loving the auto frother for my lattes. It saves me so much time! One complain is how this seems to be built cheaper than my old Barista Express, the sides are plastic and it‚Äôs so light that you really have to hold it when inserting the porta filter. It‚Äôs almost half the weight of the Mignon.

Mignon Specilita - I love how well built this seems. Have only used a few times to dial in, but it‚Äôs most definitely a night and day comparison with my old built in grinder on BBE.

Planning a limited ‚Äúmenu‚Äù and guess that most will go for a latte. I‚Äôm bringing a bottle of chai concentrate I‚Äôm familiar with for dirty chai latte that I think will be a hit.

Will be running off-grid. Van has a capable power system including 2000w inverter capable of heavy duty continuous use. Also have an Ecoflow unit capable of running it. 

Workflow will be a little slow as I‚Äôll be weighing out each dose and also weighing shot yield. I typically use a blind shaker at home then quick WDT to even out the top surface, might skip the shaker and just do WDT. I‚Äôve been making 2 shots every morning for the last 2 years and feel pretty dialed but have never made more than 3 consecutive drinks.

My kids are excited to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù by taking orders, pouring dosed beans into the hopper, etc.

I‚Äôm bringing a 2lb bag of beans that‚Äôs good for 40 shots. 1-1.5 gallons of milk. There is water at the campground or I can fill from the van.

OutIn Nano: Built-in heating, works with pods or grounds, and plugs in with USB-C, huge for hotel stays with limited space.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for and what matters to me:

* **Drinks I Make:** Mostly straight **espressos**, **latte** or **cappuccino** (1‚Äì2 drinks a day).
* **Grinder:** I‚Äôm pretty sold on the **DF54** ‚Äì great value, quiet, solid flat burrs, and everyone seems to love it for espresso. I‚Äôm not focused on single dosing right now but low retention is a nice bonus.
* **Machine Options:**
   * **Breville Bambino**: Fast startup, compact, decent steam. Not mod-friendly but great user experience.
   * **Gaggia Classic Evo Pro**: Slower workflow, but mod-capable and seems more ‚Äúreal barista machine‚Äù style.



I‚Äôm fine putting in the work if it means better espresso and longer-term satisfaction, but I also appreciate convenience. I don‚Äôt have a ton of counter space, and I‚Äôm okay upgrading parts or modding down the line if it‚Äôs worth it.



**Questions:**

1. Is the DF54 a good match for either machine?
2. Will the Bambino limit me down the road as I get more into espresso?
3. For milk drinks, is the Gaggia‚Äôs stock steam wand good enough without mods?

I‚Äôm working with omni/light roasted coffees, and I keep facing the same issue across several origins and roasters: espresso tastes clean, sometimes bright, but completely lacks body ‚Äî watery and thin. Even if the acidity is nice, the texture is just not there.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve already ruled out:
	‚Ä¢	Even puck prep (WDT + Normcore distributor/tamper combo)
	‚Ä¢	No visible signs of channeling
	‚Ä¢	I using a washed Nicaragua (variety Pacamara)
Ratio: 18g in / 36g out, 28‚Äì30 sec
	‚Ä¢	Brew temp: 93.4 C
	‚Ä¢	Pressure tested both 9.0 bar and 8.5 bar ‚Äî slightly better at 8.5-8.8

The pucks look fine post-shot (no major cracks or uneven saturation), and extraction seems consistent. Still, the cup lacks texture and mouthfeel.

My theory is: these roasts are underdeveloped (too fast or too short development time), so not enough caramelization and solubles to provide body. But I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or similar experiences:
	‚Ä¢	Do omni/light roasts inherently struggle to deliver body in espresso?
	‚Ä¢	Can pressure profiling or lower flow rate help in this case?
	‚Ä¢	What are your go-to techniques for coaxing more body out of light roasts?

Would really appreciate insights ‚Äî especially from folks working with lever machines, Decent, or Slayer-style profiles.

Thanks in advance! üôè

In conjunction with this subreddit, I often reach out to him because I hope that his information is accurate.  

After recently getting my setup, I've come under scrutiny by him for some of my choices and I thought I'd reach out here to get some third party perspective.  I don't know everything, and at the age of 45, my brain is still a sponge and I crave understanding of subjects.

he's commented that, for example, only buy local roasters beans.  Buying Starbucks (for example) is a horrible choice because they have no quality control on their roasts.  They often roast in such large batches that a medium roast is often time indistinguishable from a dark roast.  They also don't source good beans and so their coffee ""sucks"" in general.  

He also commented that I shouldn't wake up and just grind my beans with my setting from the previous day.  Each grind of beans is volatile and I could expect to daily, grind several dozen grams worth of beans to recalibrate my machine for the day.  Even if I never switch beans.  

I thought that once you dial in for a select bean you should be good.  I currently log that setting, and if I ever switch, that log gives me the best ""optimal"" setting for that previous bean.  Yes, leaving and going back might require some fine tuning (I equate to, removing iron sights or an optic from a rifle.  Putting them back in the same spot ""should"" keep your zero, but expect to be off by a bit.).

He's also really big on crema.  We've pulled some shots together that were good.  really good flavor.  But he's tossed them out because there wasn't enough crema on the shot?  He said that even though the shot had good flavor, the shot was wasted because there wasn't enough crema, resulting in poor extraction.  

I thought coffee was all about what tastes good to the drinker lol. 

Just wanted to get some feedback from this community.  I know there are people that will probably side with my friend and die on those hills.  As a newbie to this process, I know I have a lot to learn.  Change is scary and humbling and if his opinions hold weight, I'd rather get 2d opinions than feel like he's just being a snob.  "

8,2025-07-10,Moddifying espresso machine,u/Radiant-Seaweed-4800,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lweps7/moddifying_espresso_machine/,"I wish to modify my espresso machine. I own a bellezza francesca leva dual boiler, and I am very happy with it. But one detail I do not like: the noise of the pump. For this reason, I am thinking about changing the vibration pump for a rotary pump.
Now, rotary pumps usually use a giant induction motor, which probably won't fit into my machine.
To avoid this, I thought about fitting a stepper or servo motor to a rotary pump body (Fluid-o-tech MA0074BFANN0000), because steppers and servos offer quite good power/size ratios. Alternatively, I could use an easy bldc (maybe with gearbox)
Now, I am not sure of the RPM and the torque the motor needs in order to sufficiently supply the pump.

The way rotary pumps usually run, they overdeliver (by a lot) and all of the access pumped water gets reflown into the pump in the bypass valve right after the pump.
My idea is to throw this idea out the window and instead set the bypass higher than it needs to be (10 or 11bar) and control the motor speed to directly control flow or pressure. The flow/rev should be constant, and the pressure can be easily measured with an additional pressure probe.
With this I get additional pressure/flow profiling.


What do you think of this idea, (am I even in the right subreddit,) have you made similar modifications and got experience, is this a horrible idea...

Really having fun with the Bambino and the DF54. The Bambino is not well suited for straight espresso it seems but I am still having fun trying to get sweeter and more juicier shots out of it. The DF54 is a huge step up from my Hario hand grinder though tbh grinding coffee with my teeth would have been a step up too."

I currently make pourover coffee at home, and am looking to add in espresso to my at home rotation. One thing is, I have gotten back into making coffee after stopping for about two years. The last time I was making coffee at home, I had this cheap blade coffee grinder that I have since misplaced. I would like to buy a conical burr grinder, a hand one. Something about a hand grinder speaks to me, I like that it doesn't take up counter space, and I feel like something manual has fewer opportunities to break. 

To be clear, I would like to purchase a grinder that can allow grind settings for both espresso and pour-over. 

My dad asked his coffee affection-ado coworkers for grinder recommendations. One they recommended was the 1Zpresso J-Ultra Foldable Coffee Grinder, Iron Grey. I looked into it, and it seems it's more ideal for only espresso. One alternative I found was the 1Zpresso J Manual Coffee Grinder Silver Capacity 35g with Assembly Stainless Steel Conical Burr - Numerical Internal Adjustable Setting, which seems like it's equally useful for espresso and pourover, and a little more affordable to boot. 

  
Does anybody have experience with either of these devices? My mom was acting like a manual grinder would be a huge waste of energy, but manual burr grinders seem easy to use to me ( unlike manual blade).

[Rancilio SPX],u/Party-Evening3273,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lwk9h0/15_minute_group_head_clean_tip_works_great/,"I didn‚Äôt have any commercially made cleaning solution to clean my group head. I tried soaking the parts in vinegar but it was painfully slow with little progress. 

I put a pot of water to boil and placed a dishwasher detergent tab in it. After the tab dissolved and water boiled, I took a little bit of the solution out to scrub the bottom of the group head that cannot be removed with a small stiff brush and later rinsed with clean water. 

Meanwhile, the screen, screw, gasket, and other group head parts that can be removed were placed in the boiling pot. It only took about 15 minutes and the parts came out completely clean with no scrubbing needed.  I rinsed with clean water after to remove any of the soap residue. 

I know the gasket is made for high temperature but I didn‚Äôt know if keeping it in boiling water for 15 continuous minutes would damage it. It kept its form and density throughout the process without bending out of shape.  I did make an effort to keep it on top of the other parts so the gasket wasn‚Äôt directly touching the bottom of the pot. Gasket looks like new. 

Prior to cleaning, parts were covered with a thick and sticky tar like substance from the coffee and bean oils. I knew when I drank my first coffee sip and it tasted acrid and nasty that it was time for a cleaning. Hope this helps someone. "

Just like many people have had problems with this machine, mine stopped going above 165F one random day. It had happened in the past but the tilt method, leaving it plugged out overnight, etc revived it. This time nothing worked. I read a couple of threads that seem to suggest it's a problem with the thermocouple.

My machine is out of warranty, but I reached out to Breville support anyway. They sent a box to get the machine shipped and just got back with a quote. The parts they have mentioned are worth $33 (thermostat mentioned there as well), but the labor charge is $305 (after a 25% discount). Do people think that these parts are easy to find and replace as a DIY project and save the $305, or is it too risky and let the professionals handle it?

Hi, 
I‚Äôm a coffee lover but not a pro in all terms of making coffee soooo I need some advice üòÖ.

I‚Äôm making a mobile coffee cart for events like farmers markets and weddings. I‚Äôve already spoken to my local coffee repair technicians and they said that they can repair almost all coffee machines.. that aside, I know how important a good grinder is so I purchased the above as I‚Äôve read and heard that it‚Äôs decent. (I have a breville barista touch at home and I‚Äôve yet to pull a decent shot of espresso from it). 

I‚Äôve also contacted and found the place where I want to get my beans from (locally of coarse)! The last thing and most worrying thing on my mind is the espresso machine itself and the generator (which I‚Äôll purchase depending on what kind of machine I‚Äôm buying). I‚Äôm looking for something kind of compact but also able to pull its weight in producing shots back to back. 

I put my budget as 2-3k max BUT if there‚Äôs something out there that will definitely be my forever machine I‚Äôm willing to put more into it. "

Feel helpless and like giving up. Fresh beans. Farted around with so many permutations and combinations. My double cup basket is 19g max (I did the dime test) so I try to use 19g lighter roast coffee. Proper tamping and WDT tool usage. Most cups would produce 52g coffee out. Extractions were about 40 seconds so I made grind coarser until it started spraying (naked 54mm portafilter) so I had to get finer again. But it still tastes bitter so I reduced grind amt slowly to 18g before it started spraying to reduce extraction/pre infuse time. Pre infuse was 14 seconds. I now started pull manual shot on bambino to reduce pre infuse to 7 seconds and 38g total shot time in 35 seconds pull and 36grams. Still bitter/sour. What to do??

I am looking in the 500-700 euro range in the Netherlands. For my grinder, I have already ordered a DF54. I will mostly be making milk drinks.

Currently I am considering 3 machines, but am open to whatever else you guys think of:
- Gaggia Classic E24 (‚Ç¨450)
- Quickmill 820 (‚Ç¨620)
- Rancilio Silvia (‚Ç¨640)

I was going to buy the Gaggia, but my family has some good experience with the Quickmill's reliability, and indeed I can't find many complaints about it. My only worries for the Quickmill are lower steam power due to the thermoblock, and the nonstandard portafilter size. 

I was also considering the Silvia, but as a complete beginner I was put off by comments that the steam power is so good that you can easily scald your milk (the Gaggia seemed like a good middle ground in that sense). I am also not really interested in adding a PID or doing a lot of manual fiddling or temperature surfing to deal with the Silvia's reported temperature instability.

So in short, my priorities are:
- Ease of use without modification
- Suitability for milk drinks
- Reliability
- Ease of maintenance
- Standard portafilter size if possible

I've been flip-flopping between these machines for a bit. What do you guys think? Is there a different machine I should be considering? Thanks!!"

For my first attempt at the drain, I used clear plastic flexi line. Considering it was a 30-foot run and between all the bends, the flexible tube did not work. I went back and PVC'd the line so there were no hard bends that crimped the line, and as well as I could add a vent. In doing so, I brought the PVC above the counter to connect to the flexible line, as that is what connects to the espresso drain port, since I didn't want the flexible line crimping at the bend to make its way under the counter.

Well, the connecting piece between the flexible line and PVC is about 1/4"" too tall, and the espresso machine cannot sit flat on the counter on its own. I propped it up on 2x4s for now, but this is not the look we're going for, lol.

I am having an issue which I can not figure out. My shots vary sometimes from 10 to 20oz when pulling a single shot. 

My setup is a breville barista express (I know, not great) and a DF64 gen 2. 

I ended up thinking I was close to dialing in a roast, but with the same process: grind, wdt, distribution, tamp with a 30lb tamper, and added puck. Im getting large variance still.  I have done the opv mod to pull at 9 bar as well.

I am not sure whats going on. Id greatly appreciate any advice!

I do 80% espresso (half the time espresso other half milk drink) and 20% pour over (V60). I buy fresh beans from local roster medium to dark roast usually. I have a J max conical and a Q2 heptagonal conical manual grinder. I am not particularly bothered by the manual aspect of my setup but sometimes wonder how easier would be my workflow with an electric grinder (for those time where I am in a rush).

Right now I wonder if I should add an entry level flat burr like the df54 or a more expensive timemore 064s. The bigger ounterspace footprint won't be a plus but I probably can make it work.

I am exploring fresh beans as much as I can and my best friend just offered me a coffee subscription. 

Only coffee drinker in my home and 2 coffee per day. Espresso machine is an ascaso dream pid.

Should I just stick with my current setup?

Thanks."

I'm in the process of opening a small caf√© in a medium-sized town in Germany, and I would appreciate advice from anyone with experience in selecting commercial espresso machines/grinders for low-to-moderate volume.

Some context:

I'm targeting around 30‚Äì50 espresso-based drinks per day to start, potentially growing as word spreads.

I‚Äôll be running the bar semi-solo at the beginning, so workflow and reliability are big priorities. The caf√© will serve espresso, cappuccino, flat white, latte, and I also want to incorporate decaf.

I‚Äôm leaning toward starting with a 1-group machine to save space and reduce upfront investment, but only if that won't bottleneck quality or service. Happy to get thoughts on this.

I've been reviewing other threads & am open to leasing, if it's a smart long-term choice. Also, I don't really know if ‚Ç¨6000 makes sense, but I had to put down a number to follow guidelines.

I would appreciate some input regarding the below:

* Is a 1-group commercial machine viable for this kind of volume, especially during small rushes (e.g., 3‚Äì5 customers ordering back-to-back)?
* For those who've used or run a caf√© with a 1-group machine: any regrets or did it serve you well at startup?
* Which machines/models would you personally recommend and why?
* Any ‚Äúavoid at all costs‚Äù brands/models I should steer clear of?
* Have you leased a machine from a roaster or service provider? If so, would you recommend that route to conserve startup capital?

I‚Äôve read through some amazing advice on this subreddit (shoutout to everyone in that 2-year-old thread!) and it‚Äôs been incredibly helpful. I want to get this decision right because I know the espresso machine is the beating heart of the caf√©.

Thanks you"

I got tired of preparing a regular cup of coffee up to 6 times a day so I reluctantly rolled into the nearby Starbucks (I know, I know) and it was all down hill from there. Now, I have a newly purchased Synchronika II and a Eureka Libra grinder to try and get some of my money back üòÇ

How were you first introduced to espresso? Is there a back story behind your first experience? How old were you? "

I specifically use the Eureka 65mm Red Speed burrs. Paired with my Quick Mill Pop Up, I usually am not able to grind something like a medium-dark roast fine enough for a shot that should take at least 30s, I instead may get about 38g in 16s. My understanding is that I should be able to grind to a Turkish level of fineness quite easily.

I wanted to mention that I use high extraction baskets, which I am not too familiar with exactly. I have 2 Normcore baskets, 18g and 22g, and a 22g IMS All in One. I have seen some people say a shot should take much less time with a high extraction basket, and I have wondered if I am therefore not actually experiencing issues with grinding fine enough and should just have different expectations. 

Am I misunderstanding high extraction baskets, are 65mm Red Speed burrs not as capable, or are they just misaligned (I have tried to align them, could I have perhaps just done a poor job?) Curious about seeing what would get me shots that take longer. 

To be clear, the espresso tastes fine, but I wonder if I am simply missing out on even more that could be extracted. "

It‚Äôs built like an absolute tank! Really is a thing of beauty. MaraX did me very well, even brought it with us from Scotland when we moved! It‚Äôs made copious amounts of coffee for us sleep deprived parents and our guests. Great steaming power for its size and takes up hardly any space.

Allground Sense grinder is awesome. Grind by weight is so good when doing back to back drinks. It is a little messy on smaller baskets, a few stray grinds will fly off the heap in the basket but a dosing ring stops that. Either way, with it being grind by weight it doesn‚Äôt affect the dose as it doesn‚Äôt stop until it hits the target weight. I‚Äôve tested it a dozen times and the weight is absolutely bang on compared to two different scales I tested it on. It‚Äôs nice and quiet, built very well and looks cool in my opinion.

I believe I have the grind size relatively right for this bean because at dose size 16g, any smaller and the flow is slow and a couple notches bigger and its way too fast. I am definitely getting some channeling because the puck is nasty and loose on top after, and I have a ‚Äúdonut extraction‚Äù every time and a lot of spitting and sometimes even spraying.

For puck prep, I don‚Äôt have a wdt because in my little experience with non-starbucks machines, it wasn‚Äôt necessary. I use the catch cup with my measured amount of beans and circle around the filter basket (always the angle walled non pressured basket from breville) and then lift so theres a little mound on top, then I tamp basically as hard as I can. I have noticed that the tamp is a tad smaller than the basket so theres sometimes a little collection of grounds on the walls. Ive thrown the screen on there and while it stops the nasty top, it still donuts and tastes like channelling.

I had 1 good shot, not too bitter not too acidic, and have failed to replicate that. Most of my shots are very bitter, some completely undrinkable it‚Äôs so bitter.

My question is if its in my puck prep and I need to either tamp less/more and maybe wdt, or could it be my equipment, like the tamp not getting the sides well enough?"

TLDR - a bubble of air got caught in my Ascaso Steel Duo's pump suction line and prevented my pump from pulling in water. 

I did a descale and backflush of my Ascaso yesterday, and Ive never had issues before. It's probably been about a dozen times now. I noticed my pump sounding a little ""off"" about halfway through the process and didn't think much of it. After trying to pull a shot later, I noticed my pump could barely build pressure. I tried a blind basket and my pump could only hit around 6 bar even with that. My pump was also much louder than it normally was. I thought that maybe it had sucked air into itself and that I would have to call a repair guy.

It also leaked water everywhere, but that isn't the issue. While I'm not too worried about finding a replacement hose at a good plumbing supply company, I AM worried about any damage this may have caused the pump. Ya see, I set it all up in accordance with the instructions and then, in accordance with the manual, I let it run for ""at least 30 seconds until water is being dispensed from the brew group before pressing the coffee button again to stop filling the boiler."" It was loud -clearly the result of cavitation in the pump, which was straining to pull in water through a leaky hose. I incorrectly allowed the pump to operate dry for approximately 45 seconds before it finally pulled in enough water (against the leaky tube) to stop straining. In hindsight, I realized that the abnormally loud pump noise was due to cavitation, which I know can result in damage.

Should I demand a replacement pump or a whole new machine under warranty? Or just replace the hose and hope for the best?

This is my first machine and I will be mostly making milk drinks. I like the all-in-one nature of the Pro, but I also understand the versatility of buying a separate grinder. If I went with the Bambino, I'd buy a grinder for < $300 if possible. 

It would be great to go with the non-plus Bambino to save money and put it toward the grinder, but the automatic steam wand sounds handy. Do I need it should I just take the time and learn how to do it myself? Anything else the plus has that would be worth the $100 jump? 

I'm leaning toward the Pro because I heard it got better baratza grinders and I'm not too picky at all right now just starting out. I heard it has a good steam wand, starts up really fast, and has solid build quality. I'm only reconsidering now because I heard a lot of people are finding them for $499 in Home Goods and other places. I didn't find one near me, unfortunately. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! "

I feel that most of the coffees that I drink as a pour over are light to medium roast. Am I correct in assuming I should look for a grinder that is capable of handing light roast and it should tackle medium without issues? 

I keep seeing things like the Sculptor 064, DF 64  (is this from a specific vendor cause it seems sketchy) and the Niche Zero. Ideally single dose, solid grind speed but able to handle that light roast around the $500 range with with wiggle room "

I'm deep down the rabbit hole researching my next espresso machine and I'm heavily leaning towards the Profitec MOVE. I've scourged YouTube and Reddit, but since it's a newer model, detailed long-term reviews are a bit limited.

Currently, I'm using a Bambino Plus paired with a Niche Zero grinder. My daily routine involves one latte and one Americano on weekdays. On weekends, I'll make 2 lattes back-to-back, and occasionally, when friends or family visit, I'll be pulling 2-4 lattes or americanos consecutively.

I don't feel the Profitec Go would be a significant enough upgrade from my Bambino Plus, and I'm really looking for a machine that will reliably serve me for over seven years. My budget is around $2,000 to $2,200.

I've ruled out the Ascaso Steel Duo due to the plug situation ‚Äì I'm not keen on buying a US market machine that requires a separate converter.

I really like the style and compact size of the Profitec MOVE.

Here are the potential cons I've noted:

Steam Power: I've seen some reviews mention weak steam, though apparently, this can be resolved by switching to a 4-hole tip. As long as it's better than the Bambino Plus, I'll be happy.

Heat-up Time: At around 12 minutes, it's considerably longer than the Bambino Plus. This isn't a huge deal for my morning routine, as I'm usually busy with other tasks like unloading the dishwasher and packing for the kids before making coffee.

Pre-order: I'm fine with waiting, as my Bambino Plus is still fully functional.

Beyond the steam power and heat-up time, are there any other flaws or significant cons of the Profitec MOVE that I should be aware of before placing an order?

Ultimately, my main reason for upgrading is my enjoyment of making lattes, Americanos, and practicing latte art.

I'm also very curious: will the taste difference between shots from a Bambino Plus and the MOVE be genuinely noticeable?

Any insights from current Profitec MOVE owners or those with experience upgrading from a Bambino Plus would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!"

Every now and then I drink an espresso at my local go-to roaster and the espresso is (as can be expected i guess) very well balanced and really delicious. They are using a La Cimbali machine (fwiw M200 Profile) and a La cimbali grinder as well. I ask them what beans they are using that day and I buy those beans and try to get a SOMEWHAT similar espresso at home.

At home I use a Lelit Bianca and DF64 (with stock burrs). Now I understand that there's a ton of factors that will affect the flavour. I don't have the same machine, grinder or water (and different environment etc). But I was hoping to get at least SOMEWHAT close to what I drink at the roaster. I asked for the ""recipe"", which is 16g in, roughly 40g out in 23-26 seconds at 90C (194 Fahrenheit). What strikes me is that the beans are between medium and light roast. If I try to target those numbers, the espresso is almost not drinkable. What kinda works for me is 16g in, 40g out in 50sec (incl. total of 20sec preinfusion). And the drink is at that point still just drinkable and nowhere near as balanced compared to what my roaster produces.

Would any of you have any clue on how 16in/40out/90C/23sec can produce from a somewhat light roast a really well balanced espresso and at home I cant produce a drinkable shot with anything close to those numbers? The somewhat-ok espresso I get at home doesnt taste anything like at the roaster..."

Does anyone go straight to an endgame setup like a Niche Zero and LM or similar? 

What are other pro's and con's to both paths? 

Pro from the upgrade path that i can think of: 
- you learn what you are looking for in a machine, before buying expensive.
- maybe you are 'forced' to learn better techniques? 
- less total money spend if you come to realise it's in fact not for you

Pro's of straight to endgame:
- probably spend less money overall by not buying machines and selling for less
- maybe less 'frustration' from dealing with ""inferior"" machines (I'm thinking an inconsistent machine making it harder to dial in) 
- missing part of the hobbby that revolves around the gear and joy of upgrading and having new things (if thats what you're into) "

Very happy with the Bellona for the price as well.  It happily pull 3 doubles nearly back to back while steaming 2 servings of milk.  

Two questions for the group; where are you sourcing fresh espresso beans?

It‚Äôs okay, but extremely dark and doesn‚Äôt seem as fresh as I‚Äôd like.

Trying to decide between these grinders for my setup and tasting preferences. I'll give a point form rundown, to start:

* I am located in Canada and need the grinder to be easily available for online order in Canada, without any import fees.
* I mainly drink black double shots, although will occasionally make a cortado.
* I will be using fresh, locally roasted medium to dark espresso beans. I really do not like acidic espresso. Additionally, I generally prefer a ratio of 18g / 36g.
* My machine is a Breville Bambino Plus. I have good puck prep (WDT tool, gravity distribution tool, calibrated tamper, paper filter and then puck screen) and I use the machine optimally (preheating/blank shots).
* I need the grinder to be on the quieter side. I would prefer for it to not be louder than the humming/buzzing of my Bambino Plus when pulling shots. If this isn't realistic, please provide some feedback.
* I need the grinder to be single dose; I hate the look of a huge hopper, and I will obviously be single dosing.
* I will be using RDT, so not sure if the difference between bellows/TIMEMORE's rotary knocker will matter?

Now that you all have some information about my requirements, what do y'all think? From my research, the Mignon Zero seems to fit the bill for the specific espresso roast level/in-out ratio I prefer. However, research is also telling me that the Sculptor 064S and 078S are good options as well, that are more capable with light roasts and are faster/maybe quieter?. Confuses me, because I will not be using acidic, light roast beans. With only the type of coffee I use, will either of the Sculptors actually perform better than the Mignon Zero?

At first it was only happening on the first use of the day, now it happens several times in a row throughout the day.

What's supposed to happen is after pre-infusion, the pump gradually ramps up to full power until the shot is fully pulled. What's been happening, which you can hear in the video, is the pump will go from 0 to 100 instantly before pre-infusion is finished, and then kinda restarts and gradually ramps back up, all in a couple seconds. It still pulls a shot, it's just not great. Any insight would be very much appreciated."

I really want to buy an espresso machine one day, but unfortunately I have a very severe phobia of roaches and I've heard some horror stories about roaches being attracted to go inside of espresso machines.

I'm unfortunately in a part of the world that is hot / humid and roaches are common year-round, but especially in the summer months.

I know the straightforward general things you should do, i.e. keep your entire living space clean, regularly clean and dry the parts of the espresso machine that are wet or have coffee, etc. I also already know some advice from researching about what to do if you find bugs in your espresso machine.

I'm wondering if anyone has any other specific advice, tips, or tricks for how to¬†***prevent***¬†this kind of thing from happening in the first place. I have bad anxiety and I would feel really scared, paranoid and stressed thinking that something is gonna crawl out of my machine.

For example, I'm wondering if it would be effective if, after each use of the espresso machine, putting it inside of a sealed container or wrapping a plastic bag around the entire thing and tying it off so that it is in a sealed container/bag each night? Or is there anything else I could do? I want to understand if it's a realistic possibility for me to make sure this never happens, or if by buying an espresso machine I have to expect some possibility of roaches inside. Please just be realistic with me and don't try to spare my feelings or give reassurance, I want to understand what situation I would be getting myself into. I would be willing to invest significant money in preventing this situation. Thank you for your thoughts in advance!"

We all know the rabbit hole of this hobby can get expensive. I was tired of manually checking for sales on a grinder I wanted from a few different specialized online shops.

To solve this, I built a Chrome extension called Price Tracker. It's universal, so you can use it to monitor a specific machine on a European site or a bag of single-origin beans from a local roaster. You just click the price on the page, and it will alert you if it changes.

The free version tracks up to 10 items. I thought it might be genuinely useful for others here trying to dial in their setup without breaking the bank.

Hope it helps!

Im coming from a bean to cup machine so very new to the true espresso world, it has done ok up until now but since ive started getting a somewhat expensive coffee subscription im left thinking there must be more.

Ive found a few items for sale on fb marketplace, i thought it would be best to try at a fraction of the cost before fully submerging myself into the world of espresso coffee.

Ive found the following

Grinder - Eureka Mignon Specialita barely used ¬£260 which i was looking to pick up (i also have a v60 and aeropress i would use this to grind for)

I just cant decide on the machine to use:

1) USED- sage bambino ¬£190 basically brand new
2) USED - Gaggia Classic pro ¬£270 recently serviced with 9 bar mod
3) NEW- sage bambino ¬£270  with discount code and would benefit that the warranty would be valid


Im not particularly bothered about auto steaming so havent included the bambino plus but it would hopefully encourage the other half to make me a coffee if that was an option.

I currently have to get up at 5.30 am so I'm warming to the bambino for ease in the mornings, from my understanding i would have to wait for the gaggia to heat up but is the all round better machine albeit has its limitations, i.e faffing around with the water surfing  and milk frother wand articulation.

Generally with the bean to cup, i add a bit of water to make an americano or have a small bit of milk with a shot of espresso, I dont know if this makes a difference with the machine choices.

Is the gaggia still usable with short time windows or would i be better off with the bambino?

My heart is saying gaggia, but for my personal situation my head is saying bambino especially as a newcomer but would welcome peoples thoughts who don't spend 30 mins preparing for the perfect espresso in the mornings.

I disassembled the grinder, took the anti-clumping gate out and cleaned all the parts thoroughly- grind burrs, rubber pieces, plastic parts, everything. I left the anti-clump gate out upon reassembly. I've done this process several times a month for a couple months and I'm at my wit's end.

Some days it works just fine. Other days I have to use a wooden chopstick shoved up the chute to dislodge stuck grounds, hit it with compressed air, and then grind the shot again. Some days it's fine in the morning, and acts up in the afternoon.

Anyways, is Dedica a good machine? Through limited research, I've heard good things are non-basket 'something something"" but honestly didn't do a whole lot of research. Also a bottomless porta filter a must? Does the tamper that come with the Dedica look good enough? dont want to spend much more after the $200 on the Dedica. also have a 20% coupon to target so if they have any of these accessories, then I may get them there. love espresso (specifically latte) and Starbucks is $6+ per drink so l'd like to just make my money back over what? 30-40 drinks? 

Any and all help/information/tips are much appreciated. Thanks y'all!

I got this machine off marketplace. Initially I got no flow. I tried running vinegar through it to descale, but they wasn't enough. I disassemble the machine, testing flow at each connection from the water tank onward, and isolated the problem to the valve selecting espresso-standby-steam/hot water. I soaked that in vinegar overnight, which did enough to get show going both through the group head and the steam wand. After reassembling, I ran a pint of vinegar through it, then two full tanks of cold tap water, and things seemed to be running well. But it's my first machine, so what do I know.

My grinder cannot go fine enough for espresso. I have a relatively cheap hand grinder. I tried the grind analysis tool from https://education.unspecialty.com/tools, and it's saying my average particle size is around 750 um, way too coarse for espresso. However, I can go fine enough to get no flow. Even with fresh beans, I'm not getting much crema, either. I am using a WDT in my puck prep, and this is a normcore high extraction basket (don't all me why).

The duo temp pro doesn't have a pressure gauge. I've ordered a portafilter gauge to confirm, but I suspect the pressure/flow is still compromised. I ran five more pints on vinegar through it this evening, then flushed with clean water. The photos and video is what I see from the group head, and with the shower screen removed. Any comments on that flow?

I should be getting a lend of a good grinder on Monday to do some better testing, but I thought I'd reach out here for more ideas. Similar posts I've found suggest if the pressure is low after all the cleaning and descaling then the pump may need to be replaced.  I really hope it doesn't come to that."

I recently purchased a second-hand Dedica Arte machine from Facebook marketplace and have been testing it out, but I‚Äôve run into a couple of issues.

First, when pulling a shot, a few drops of espresso come out first before the actual extraction begins.
This seemed unusual, so I searched for videos of others using the same machine, and none of them had this issue.
I thought it might be a settings problem, so I performed a factory reset following the manual.
I also used the finest grind setting (Baratza Encore) and tamped firmly, but the issue still persists.

Second, the machine extracts an unusually large amount of espresso.
When dosing around 14g of coffee, it pulls about 70‚Äì80g of espresso, which seems excessive.

Since it‚Äôs my first time using this machine, I‚Äôm not sure if the issue lies with the machine or if I‚Äôve set something up incorrectly.
However, the first problem seems clearly related to the machine itself.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or insights on what could be causing these problems."

But as I've started to invest in local, fresh roasted beans, and have actually tried to dial it in, I've been finding it impossible to pull a shot that's not bitter. At one point, I was only getting sour shots, but now I seem to be at the other end of the spectrum.

I've gone coarser. I've gone finer. I've adjusted my internal burr grinder to go extra fine. I've cleaned my grinder. I've done the salami shot method to see where I'm going wrong. My yield consistently seems too high (watery, usually 60g), even on the finest setting, and all of it is bitter. Takes about 36 seconds. I've tried out increasing my dosage to try to combat this, but no luck. Have tried 14g, 15g, 16g, 17g, and 18g with all other variables static. If I go super fine, or increase my dosage, I get no yield at all. 

What am I doing wrong? Is it my beans? Is it temperature? Does something internal need to be cleaned? Do I just suck? Any advice would be much appreciated!"

Based in Europe. I've been using the DF64E paired with a Profitec Go, and it‚Äôs been solid for a while. Lately though, I‚Äôve run into some issues - mainly high retention and a pretty limited dialing range. It struggles with lighter roasts, so I‚Äôve mostly stuck with medium-dark stuff.

I usually drink straight espresso, with the occasional milk drink (hot or iced).

Was eyeing the Eureka Oro SD Pro, but I‚Äôve seen mixed feedback on retention and build, so I‚Äôm hesitant.

Open to other options. Budget is around $500, can stretch a bit if it‚Äôs really worth it.

I recently bought this Delonghi Dedica used from someone I know after it was send in to Delonghi for repairs in the warranty period replacing the pump. The person bought a new machine immediately when sending it in because they didn't want to wait for the repair. 

I bought the machine just testing the original portafilter with the pressurized basket but got this portafilter with an unpressurized basket and some accessoires from the seller. They used to use this bottomless portafilter before the repair and it worked.

Now my problem is that the group head gasket leaks with this portafilter. I've now tried it a few times changing things like dosing to make sure I didn't overfill the basket but nothing has helped. This unpressurized basket weirdly works with the original portafilter but not when I try it with this bottomless one. Sometimes the gasket is in the normal position after ""popping"" but sometimes it loosens itself and I have to reseat it. 

I already cleaned the gasket and shower screen, tried filling it with less coffee but I am not sure how the portafilter even manages to loosen itself like that and be in there tilted without breaking the guides where the portafilter wings rest. 

Any advice would be much appreciated "

I‚Äôve had my Sage Bambino Plus for about 1.5 years now, and overall I‚Äôve been really happy with it. It‚Äôs been a great machine for my daily espresso and milk drinks.

However, over the past 2‚Äì3 months I‚Äôve run into a recurring issue:
When I try to steam milk, the machine starts as normal, but then suddenly stops mid-process and the buttons start flashing. After that, I have to run the water purge cycle (twice) before it works again. But then when I try to steam milk again, the same thing happens ‚Äî it stops, flashes, and requires flushing again.

It seems like something might be clogged or blocked internally, maybe in the steam path? I descaled the machine about 2‚Äì3 weeks ago, but the issue still persists.

I‚Äôm still within the warranty period, but I‚Äôd prefer to fix this myself if it‚Äôs something simple (rather than going through the whole return process).

Has anyone experienced this before? Should I try running a few more descaling cycles, or does this sound like a more serious hardware issue?

Thanks in advance!

Can anyone give me any good reason to spend an extra¬†`[`525‚Ç¨`]`¬†on a Profitec Move compared to the Rancilio Silvia Pro X?

I like to ""nerd"" coffee, and the ability to tweak the shot, but mostly just want a machine that can do a really good espresso and steam at the same time.  
I also like the look of both machines, but that Silvia have a bit smaller footprint (size) is a bit appealing due to limitations countertop space.  
My wife whom have no interest in equipment, just want at machine that can make a cappuccino. So there are no ""wife approval factor"" on fancy features.

I have the money to spend, if there are any really good reason.

1. I've seen brands like Nuova Simonelli, Rocket Espresso, La Marzocco (a lot of these), Sanremo, Faema, Schaerer and so on. So I can't help but wonder, are there ""specialties"" that some brand may focus on? Or would I expect kind of similar features across brands with the same price range?

2. For grinders, it has been stressed that single-dose are nicer to prevent beans going stale from air contact, but on a commercial scale, it might not be feasible. For grinders with hoppers filled to meet the day's needs, would there be a big loss or difference in taste of the beans from sitting inside the hopper for hours?

I've had an amazing latte in China from a chain coffee store (uses fully automatic Schaerer) and just like anyone else, I'm trying to check if it's feasible start-up cost-wise to open a shop where I live (the Philippines), thus the machine questions. I want to understand the possible shortcomings of a $10,000 espresso machine compared to a $20,000 one, and the differences across brands, while simultaneously experimenting with my own home setup."

Once triggered, there's the type which works again once cooled down, and the type with a little button (depicted here, button is red in this case). 
Once triggered, the button has to be pushed to work again.

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd use the flow control (kind of intimidating) on the Bianca, and some of the other programming makes me nervous. The Micra is expensive, but seems simpler. Not too crazy about having to be tied to using an app, though. I‚Äôm very tech-savvy, just don‚Äôt want to have my machine tied to an app Thoughts? Is it worth it in taste difference?

So I have a Varia VS3 gen 2, and cannot grind lower than 4. It‚Äôs recommended in the 3 or 2 range.

I have a Lelit anna and I have adjusted the valve for less pressure so now I have around 8.5 - 9 instead of 10-11. My temperature is around 92 for a Medium Roast. I am noticing the espresso is just not as thick or strong in my Iced Latte, yes these are fresh beans.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to get the grind to be finer?"
2,2025-07-13,Upgrade Advice/ [$3-4000 budget],u/Zrealm,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lyw75g/upgrade_advice_34000_budget/,"I could use some advice - currently I have a Breville Dual Boiler and a DF64 with the SSP burrs and I've been pretty happy with them - I've largely been avoiding the upgradeitis urge. Well, until about 3 weeks ago when we had a massive pipe burst in our house and basically everything in our kitchen was pretty seriously damaged or destroyed, including both of those (who could have forseen that hundreds of gallons of water shouldn't be spilled onto your coffee equipment?). Thankfully insurance is going to cover it but it does mean I need to replace both of these.

So with that in mind I figured I should get some opinions on if I should take this opportunity to upgrade. In general I make myself and my wife (and sometimes our roommate) milk drinks each morning and occasionally 3-6 drinks in an evening when we have people over. Ocassionally we'll have a board game day and have a \*lot\* of people over and I might end up making as many as 20 or 25 drinks throughout an afternoon, so I really want something with a decent workflow. I drink straight espresso as well and enjoy medium roasts but noone else does, it's all milk drinks.  
  
I'm willing to give up a tiny bit of taste for a significant quality of life upgrade, which is making me think maybe a GBW grinder is the way to go. I live about 20 minutes from Chris's Coffee, which posts seem to think is a fairly good place to purchase from and it looks like they do service, so it presumably makes sense to buy something from them for ease of servicing. I'm looking at either the Quick Mill QM67, the Quick ill Vetrano 2B, the Bianca V3 or the Izzo Alex Duetto IV Plus combined with the Eureka Mignon Libra.

I have been doing pour over for years and decided it was time to get into the world of espresso. I have been doing copious research for a couple months now and feel a bit overwhelmed/stumped. I originally was set on the Robot, but then decided I would probably eventually get a semi-automatic machine and having the 58mm portafilter option from the flair 58+ 2 seemed enticing. Knowing I would be able to use more accessories that would be able to be changed over from the manual to the semi-automatic. Also brewing a lot of light roasts the preheat feature is nice. Then came the Fellow Espresso Series 1 announcement.. I was more interested in the manual machines because they claim to create espresso quality that would compare to $3,000-$5,000 machines. But now the Fellow ES1 claims it will be able to do temperature, and pressure profiling, be able to give you feedback on the shots pulled, and will have an auto correction feature to fix the shot if the prep wasn‚Äôt ideal. These were really the main features a manual lever machine would offer, but with a seemingly easier work flow, and a steam wand included. I dont plan to do milk drinks daily but I do plan to do them, so if I would to go with a manual machine I would most likely end up getting something like the flair wizard to make milk drinks, another reason a semi-automatic like the Fellow ES1 would be nice to have. My big concern is, the Fellow machine is a first generation from a company that hasn‚Äôt done espresso before, and concerned about the reliability and long term use. I know it‚Äôs not out yet so there really is no way to speak to this concern quite yet. So the question is, do I go with the flair 58 + 2, and eventually get a semi-automatic that will do pressure, temp and possibility other profiling in the future? Do I preorder the Fellow ES1 and hope for the best, or wait for the ES1 to come out and see what people have to say with the first few months of use? Do I get something like the Flair now and wait for an ES2 model to come out or another competitor to make an equivalent machine for a similar price? Or would you recommend a completely different route than what I am thinking? I really dont want to spend a large amount of money on something that is fixed pressure, to where it wont grow with me and wouldn‚Äôt be able to make different style shots."

[Baratza Encore ESP/Gaggia Classic Pro (not Evo) ],u/Permission-Shoddy,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lywlht/inconsistent_grinds_baratza_encore_espgaggia/,"Hello everyone! I have a Baratza Encore ESP grinder and Gaggia Classic Pro (not evo line) machine setup for my espresso and recently I've had some issues, particularly with my grinder.

I've written this as a timeline of things I've tried bringing me around to the present day, so you know what I've already tried

For a while I had to grind at some of the lowest grind settings on my Encore (I'm talking like settings 1-3), and those settings were VERY fickle. My standard is a 21g in, 42g out (since my portafilter was built for 21g) and typically that works within 30 seconds.

However, recently:

* If I set it on grind setting 3 or higher, it would come out in less than 20 seconds (way too fast) and taste sour
* If I set it on grind setting 2, it would sometimes come out in around 30 seconds (and taste right) but still sometimes go too fast
* If I set it on grind setting 1, it would always come out far too slow (it would take 60+ seconds to pull 42g output)

What this indicated to me is that I needed to troubleshoot, so I did. I realized my burr holder plastic ring was cracked so I replaced that - the issue persisted. So, I then shimmed my grinder with a single washer shim, to ""raise"" the fineness reference window and hopefully allow me more give and take. I also fully cleaned out my grinder both times. For people unfamiliar with shimming, adding a single shim is ideally supposed to move the grind level ""up"" by 4-5 clicks, so if you ground on a 3 before you'd now (post shimming) grind on a 7 or 8 (ideally). 

Now that it's shimmed though, it's become EXTREMELY fine - anything below a grind level 19-20 is \*so\* fine that the espresso machine physically cannot put any water through it, but then when I grind on level 20 the shot suddenly whips around and comes streaming out, pulling in 10 or less seconds.

I hope I've made clear what my issue is: I'm not experienced enough with coffee to know by sight what coarse or fine means for grind size, but in the feedback I'm getting from pulling my shot in my machine, my grind size is completely inconsistent, whipping around wildly no matter how I change the Baratza setting. This indicates some further fault with my machine, but as I've already replaced the burr holder AND shimmed it, I have no idea what.

Note: This is all using the same exact bag of coffee so that variable is completely constant - tamping pressure is ALSO completely constant since mine is spring loaded"

Grinder: I‚Äôm currently looking to upgrade my grinder and have narrowed it down to the Timemore Sculptor 064s and the DF54. I enjoy both espresso and pour over, so the 064s seems like a strong choice for its versatility‚Äîplus, Timemore is running a 20% off summer sale. That said, I‚Äôve heard good things about the DF54 as well, and it‚Äôs a bit more budget-friendly. My ideal budget for the grinder is under $500.

Machine: I‚Äôve been leaning toward the Gaggia Classic Pro (E21) and doing some mods like PID or Gaggiuino to get the most out of it. It seems like a solid long-term machine, but I‚Äôm open to other suggestions in the sub-$1000 range that might be a better fit.

Lastly, I typically enjoy brewing light roast coffees, but every now and then I make milk-based drinks with dark/medium roasts.

Thanks in advance for your help!"

Without changing the grind size or amount or bag of beans. Sometimes it'll output so many grounds that it'll barely fit in the basket. Other times I can't tamp because it's so low.

Usually I'll just throw it out and start over. Now some grinds don't produce any grounds at all. Any ideas? And like I said I gave already pulled it apart and deep cleaned everything and repackaged the entire machine. After I took this video I tried 3 more times and got some grounds on 1, no grounds on another, and a good basket's worth on another round of grinding.

The story:
I have a hand me down Breville BES830XL that works but is showing it's age. Problem one is the pressurized basket for a double became clogged and no amount of vinager or cleaner helped. So first I went to buy an IMS basket as suggested here but the Breville is a 50mm portafilter which apparently isn't a thing. This sub taught be a 51mm Delonghi 3 eared portafilter will work. So I got a 51 mm bottomless fortafilter and a 51 mm IMS. Fits perfect one complaint is there is no warning on the mess a bottomless portafilter makes.

Second adventure. Literally in the same week our coffee bean grinder broke. I believe this was a blessing I disguise it was a ""espresso"" capable grinder but I believe the pressurized filter was hiding its lack of capabilities. From suggestions on this sub I got the Baratza ESP which not only paired with the new basket produced my best homemade shot of espresso but also grinds course beans for cold brew for my wife.

Thank you for the help and knowledge. "
29,2025-07-13,Finally figured out espresso popping boba! (I think...),u/CappaNova,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lz5kaa/finally_figured_out_espresso_popping_boba_i_think/,"I'm still in the early stages here, but I think I finally figured out a recipe to make liquid center popping boba filled with sweetened espresso. I worked off of another recipe I found for popping boba to come up with something close, since I couldn't find any other recipes using espresso or coffee to make the boba pearls. Initially I tried normal spherification, but it failed miserably. I switched to reverse spherification, which seemed pretty promising.

In the end the key was to freeze the pearls in a spherical mold first so they'd hold together until the gel forms during reverse-spherification. I haven't tried these in an iced latte,  yet, but that's next on my to-do list. To ensure I didn't over-caffeinate, these are made with decaf espresso. I tested 5 of them. Two of them didn't pop out of the mold as nicely as the others, but three of them turned out great.

Recipe below the pics. The recipe is vegan, in case that matters for some folks. The calcium lactate gluconate is based around lactic acid, not lactose from milk.

[A really nice espresso pearl!](https://preview.redd.it/a41nxmpvppcf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d9cae7b187a3db93496d7bb2cadd8aab44aecd4)

[You can see air bubbles trapped inside the gel membrane.](https://preview.redd.it/rmhp0d28upcf1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=331235bda8b303580e8de721acce3312710578ab)

What you'll need to make these:

* 90ml fresh espresso (I used decaf)
* 30g sugar (to taste, I wanted them sweet)
* 2.5g calcium lactate gluconate (CLG from here on out)
* 500ml distilled or reverse-osmosis water (zero calcium, or it could cause premature gelling)
* 2.5g sodium alginate
* Clean bowls
* Additional clean water for rinsing finished pearls
* Blender (I used a stick blender)
* Silicone sphere mold ([I bought this one.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071RMLGKP))

Prep the alginate bath:

* Sprinkle the sodium alginate into water as you blend. Blend this completely. The mixture will thicken a bit. The key is to dissolve it entirely. Scrape off anything that sticks to the blender and mix it in.
* Allow this mixture to rest at least an hour to fully hydrate. I put mine in the fridge overnight. Let it come back to room temp before making the pearls.

Prep the espresso:

* Pull espresso shots to get around 90g of espresso. I pulled two large double shots (20g dose, 45g out).
* Scrape the crema off or it will foam when you add the CLG. You could let the crema dissipate a bit to avoid losing too much liquid.
* Mix in your sugar and dissolve completely. Stir with a spoon or whisk, then allow to cool to room temperature. You can speed this up by putting it in the fridge for 15 minutes or so.
* Sprinkle in the CLG as you whisk. This will clump if you dump it in. If you see clumps, just break them up against the side of the container. Keep mixing until no more clumps exist and the CLG is fully dissolved.
* Portion into your silicone sphere mold and freeze until solid. (I froze them overnight.) You'll have a little extra liquid in case you spill any.

Form the pearls:

* Allow your alginate bath to come back to room temperature if it was refrigerated.
* Carefully pop each sphere out of the mold and drop them into the bath. You don't need to be super concerned about time left in the bath, unlike normal spherification. Just leave them long enough to gel up, at least a few minutes.
* As you add them, give the bath a gentle stir so they move around a little.
* Carefully remove the pearls with a spoon. I didn't try a fine mesh strainer, but that may work, too.
* Add the pearls to a bowl of cold clean water to rinse the alginate mixture off.
* They're now ready to drop in your drink!

I don't think these keep super long, but you may be able to preserve them for a few hours in cold, clean water. I haven't tested any preservation methods, yet. The pearls end up with a thin, flexible, and fairly sturdy gel membrane that pops when you bite it. The center is still totally liquid espresso, so you get a little gush of goodness as they pop.

Enjoy!"

When I first saw that, I had concerns. Namely, basic fluid dynamics. When water flows, there is pressure. Narrow the channel and maintain the rate, and the pressure increasing. Think of putting your thumb over a hose.

My friend got his hands on one and tried it out on a Synesso. He was not impressed. Needless to say, I wanted to give it a go on my Eagle One Prima.

I was not prepared for what happened next.

In a bottomless portafilter, the shot ran ""weird"". Distribution seem ok, but there was a pattern in it.

Then I removed the portafilter... Image 2 show massive channels like I've never seen before. Who would have thought that restricting flow would create jets of water that tunnel into the pick in the shape of the outlets?

Recently we got a Bezzera HOB01 on a very good deal in our household. The device works fine but I have two questions I could not find a straightforward answer for, so I am turning to you guys.  
  
1. I'd like to measure the brewing pressure. I have a 3/8"" manometer that I can attach to the portafilter. However, due to the design of the portafilter having two small slits on the sides, as soon as enough water is in the portafilter, it flows up and out the sides.

[Two rectangular slits at roughly 12 and 6 o'clock interfere with pressure measurement.](https://preview.redd.it/sol5ckh1kscf1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fa3aeafe1c995cbe8b4d73a563da2abf4b69c91)

I am pretty sure the portafilter itself is fine because we did manage to make espresso with the regular filter. Cleaning with a blind filter works fine as well. Any way to conveniently measure the pressure without fiddling with the hoses inside the unit?

2. Maybe a connected issue, but the previous owner seems to have either mounted the 55x8 O-ring wrong, or used the wrong one. The portafilter needs to be turned way too far to the right. Before I order the replacement rings, does anyone know if the issue is the ring itself, or an additional component?

I‚Äôm deciding between the Rancilio Silvia V6 and the Silvia Pro X. I really value durability and longevity, and I love that the Silvia is a proven workhorse that can last 15‚Äì20 years with proper care. However, the one thing I‚Äôm not too keen on is the wait time when switching from brewing to steaming. I know it‚Äôs part of single boiler life, but the 60‚Äì90 second pause (Could someone confirm this?) feels like it might get frustrating.

I‚Äôve looked into the Silvia Pro X because of its dual boiler setup, PID on both circuits, and overall upgraded performance ‚Äî but the price is steep, and I can only justify it if it‚Äôs really worth it in daily use. I‚Äôm not chasing luxury for its own sake, but if it adds real functional value and makes the whole process smoother and more enjoyable, I‚Äôd consider the stretch.

So I‚Äôm hoping to hear from those of you who‚Äôve owned or used both: Is the Pro X a meaningful upgrade, or is the V6 still the better bang-for-buck for someone who values durability but makes regular milk drinks?

Thanks in advance for your insights!

P.S. Local prices for V6 and Pro X are NZD $1500 and $3700 respectively."

Espresso Newbie here. Only the second shot with a light roast. Looking for advice/suggestions/recommendations.

Pulled a 40gms shot in 30 seconds with an 18gms dose. A slightly larger yield than the traditional 1:2 to allow the light roast to extract more. There is a bit of spraying at the beginning--possibly tamping/WDT technique issues or both? It tasted fruity and slightly sour, with a hint of bittersweet aftertaste.

**Gear:**

1. DeLonghi ECP33.21
2. MHW3-Bomber R3 Hand Grinder at 38 Clicks
3. Generic Bottomless Portafilter with the stock unpressurized basket
4. Generic WDT with Removable Needles
5. MHW3-Bomber 0.2mm puck screen
6. HiBrew 51mm Tamper

**Process:**

1. 15 Minute Machine Preheat with the Portafilter
2. Two-Blank Shots Through the Portafilter
3. Puck Prep with WDT and Tamping
4. Wait for the Machine to come up to temp.
5. Pull a blank shot into the cup without the portafilter
6. Attach the portafilter
7. Wait for the machine to come up to temp.
8. Switch the machine to steam mode for 2-3 seconds (temp-surf)
9. Pull the shot

This is a washed, light roast variety of coffee (altitude 1100-1200m) (Blue Tokai Seethargundu Estate) with Sweet Lime, Apricot and Black Tea tasting notes, and is primarily listed as suitable for Pour-overs and AeroPress. Just thought of giving it a try to see if the machine can pull it off.

Up next, planning to try it with a slightly coarser grind at 39 clicks, with a paper filter at the bottom of the puck, for a 54gms shot in 20-25 seconds for a tea-like finish, hopefully (Following Lance's recipe for the light roast in the Stilosa video).

Apologies for the bad video quality, esp. at the beginning and towards the end--recording the video, timing the shot and watching the weight--all was a bit too much for me, being the first time.

TIA for all the advice/suggestions/corrections."

I had a Bambino and a Smart Grinder Pro and I just wished I could track my shots easier and see what I would need to improve. There is so much information out there, and I just wanted something or someone to just tell me what to do, instead of doing constant research.  
  
This is when I came up with the idea of Espressync. It's an app that allows you to log your shots by inputting grind size, grind dose, yield and time (even has a built-in timer) and then being able to tag the shot with taste notes and give it a ""Poor"" / ""Good"" / ""Excellent"" verdict.  
  
If the shot is poor, the app will look at the details and offer advice based on taste notes and parameters. Once the shot is logged, you're able to share it with the community, which lets you browse, like and take inspiration from other people's shots. You can filter by the same machine and grinder that you have and hopefully find someone else with the same combination. The dashboard also feature an Analytics tab which looks at your history of shots as a whole and keeps track of what is working for you.  
  
I have just went live with this, so it is still missing a few bits and pieces, but I'm looking for feedback on this and see if this can help other people as well. The app can be accessed at: [https://espressync.com/](https://espressync.com/) and I can be contacted in this thread, on discord DMs or through the app's social links.

This was 19g of a light roast roasted within the last 3 weeks aiming for 38g out. I use a wdt, distributor, and tamp. Am I overthinking the pre infusion? How long should it really be?

I‚Äôm having a major issue with my Philips EP4349/70 coffee machine ‚Äî it won‚Äôt turn on¬†**at all**. No lights, no sounds, nothing, as if it‚Äôs completely dead.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried so far:

* Unplugged and replugged the power cable
* Tried multiple power outlets
* Pressed the power button in different ways (with different fingers, holding for several seconds)
* Tried holding the button after reconnecting the power
* Put the LatteGo on and off

Unfortunately, nothing works.

For context, I already had to send the machine in for a¬†**pump replacement**¬†once before (still under warranty at the time). Now it‚Äôs out of warranty ‚Äî I bought it in 2022 for around ‚Ç¨700 ‚Äî and Philips support over the phone wasn‚Äôt helpful. They only suggested sending it in for repair at a flat rate of¬†**‚Ç¨150**, with no guarantees.

That‚Äôs two major issues in under three years for an expensive machine, which is really disappointing.

Has anyone experienced something similar or found a fix for this kind of issue?

I'm a passionate hobby barista, currently drinking mostly medium-roast espresso shots. Over the years, I've experimented extensively with my setup, ultimately settling on a La Marzocco 14g basket that produces an incredibly delicious 1.5 shot of espresso. 

However, given the amount of coffee in the basket, I suspect I'm consuming a lot of caffeine. To manage this, I've set a limit of four cups per day, actively trying to stick to just 3 shots and avoiding coffee after 3 PM. This routine has worked well for me until...

Last week, I skip coffee for two days as an experiment and man, it was horrible. The first espresso shot I had afterward made me feel absolutely euphoric, which honestly, scares me a bit.

  
So I'm curious about your strategies for managing caffeine intake. How do you balance your love for coffee with normal caffeine levels? Do you have a specific number of cups you limit yourself to each day, or do you have other techniques?

I've tried mixing in decaf, but it's a hassle with only one grinder and it's just not satisfying raelly. Now I'm considering buying some naturally low-caffeine beans so I can maintain my 3-4 shots schedule without over-caffeinating. Has anyone switched to low-caffeine beans as go to? 

Looking forward to your suggestions and experiences!"

The Tamp is okay. The machine is quality for cold brew and makes foaming hot or cold milk very easy.

What machine is going to suit my needs and pull some amazing shots? I've looked at flair and whilst it looks great, I don't think it's for me.

Also will be in need of some simple tools to the job so brand recommendations for tamps, screens baskets etc. will be appreciated."

Last week, my mom announced that she wants to give my partner and I an early wedding gift and upgrade our espresso machine from the humble little Breville Infuser we currently have. She and my Dad got my brother and his wife the Micra a year ago for their wedding, and she was thinking of the same one for us.

I‚Äôm a pretty big coffee geek and so I know that the Micra is one of the best of the best for home machines. I‚Äôm probably going to go with that, but of course I want to take the time to carefully consider all options for such a big purchase.

**I‚Äôd like to Hear reasons**¬†***not***¬†**to buy the Micra?**¬†After reading up on it, I was surprised to learn that such a high end machine lacked what I‚Äôd have assumed would be standard features at that price point. For example, the inability to do pre-infusion unless it‚Äòs plumbed in, limited only to ‚Äúpre-brew‚Äù. We rent our home so plumbing in the machine is a non-starter, unfortunately.

**Will I be happy with ‚Äúpre-brew‚Äù or will I wish I had a controllable pre-infusion?**

Another thing that shocked me to learn when I asked my brother what he didn‚Äôt like about his machine (he absolutely loves it overall) was that the hot water spout is unsuitable for americanos and that you have to heat water in a kettle. To have a $5.5k (CAD) machine not be able to make an americano seems‚Ä¶ insane. Our most common espresso drink to make is a short americano / long black, with just 120ml of water or so. I also often like to make a¬†*very*¬†short ‚Äúlong black‚Äù and add maybe 40-50ml of water to a shot.

**Is there really no way to get hot water for a drink directly from the machine?**

**Are there any other drawbacks I should be taking into consideration?**

**I‚Äôd also love suggestions about what other machines I should be considering for the purchase.**¬†In addition to simply wanting an excellent machine, we have space requirements due to a very tiny kitchen.¬†**The Micra‚Äôs footprint is about as big as we can do without moving the grinder to another spot in the kitchen**, which is a pain for coffee prep but also means we sacrifice valuable counter space for cooking.¬†**Another sticking point is that we really need a machine that has the steam wand on the right, as our machine will be in a corner with the wall on the left.**¬†It seems like by far the majority of high end machines put the steam on the left.

I fitted the basic Encore grinder with the Preciso micro adjustment parts. Look for the lever knob just under the hopper grind adjustment numbers. I also did  the M2 burr upgrade with a thin shim addition. The M2 burr is a solid improvement in both grind quality and speed. I like improvement over replacement. This project is for those who are financially challenged, somewhat skilled and unafraid. Yes the ESP model is an off the shelf upgrade to the Encore but it lacks the Preciso micro adjustment mine now has. Warning for those who try this: There is a very thin locator pin on the bottom of the Preciso micro adjustment plate. It goes into a pre existing hole in the top of the gear box housing. It seems to be designed to shear off. Once this locator / holding pin is sheared the micro adjustment function is completely gone. For it to work the bottom plate must remain fixed in the intended position. I'm betting this locator pin part breaks all the time from normal use. I broke mine during the install. Evil engineering? I made some hash scoring marks with a razor on the bottom of the new lower plate and the top of the gear box. I drilled three small divots  part way through the gear box material where the ring sits and is snapped into place over the three holding tabs the holding. Don't drill above the grinds shoot. You might have a better method of holding the lower plate in the correct position. I support your improvement. Note that you don't want to do anything to the top of the new lower ring that will interfere with the micro adjustment parts movement. I didn't do a perfect job cutting the slot but I've always been a function over form type. The Preciso lever gives a micro up + and down - grind adjustment that splits any of the normal click adjustments from turning the hopper. I've used this grinder for about two years making espresso after I altered the factory calibration setting to be able to grind finer than the factory. It worked but I sometimes needed a mid click setting that was not there and finer grinds took a while. Learning how important  grind quality is, I wanted to be more confident in that aspect my process. I just dial in my first beans with it and it works great. Happy with the results.

Im upgrading from a fairly cheap delonghi bean to cup machine to espresso.

Ive already got a DF54 on order, but now im deciding on a machine. And im currently experiencing paralysis through over analysis.

The sensible thing would be for me to get a bambino plus and give that a go to wet my feet but i know ill probably want something better after a year or so,  so ive been looking at the Gaggia Classic pro models as i really like the idea of the cosmetic mods and some of the performance ones as well. Bambino plus is about ¬£330 and i can get a refurbed brass E24 gaggia for ¬£510 or Aluminium for ¬£475.

My questions are:

1)  having come from a bean to cup machine will the 9 bar mod make that much a difference to me taste wise or will 15bar be fine for the medium to short term? I can then look to upgrade later once ive worked out the machine. Im just worried about voiding warranty and would just like to have a nice coffee after unboxing tbh. 

2) is the gaggia actually that challenging to use or is it exaggerated? I dont have an issue with learning curves but coming from a bean to cup it would be good to be able to make a cup good enough after a few goes

3)is the machine usable out of the box, are the mods a must have or nice to have. Ive looked at gaggiuino and I wouldnt attempt that but the spring and pid upgrades look easy enough to do but I will probably look to do that once ive learnt how to use the machine.

4) how long does it actually take from turning on to get a drinkable espresso? I get up at 5 in the morning and I dont always have time to wait 15-20 mins until i can have the coffee. Should i just get a bambino plus? The reason i got the DF54 was so i could easily swap to other brew types so i could always just go to V60 or aeropress instead in this instance.

Appreciate any help"

I‚Äôve been a Breville fan for years. My original machine lasted over 7 years and I loved it. I‚Äôm in the coffee business, so people are always asking for gear recommendations, and I‚Äôve recommended Breville machines to hundreds of customers and friends over the years.

When that first machine finally gave out, I upgraded to the Barista Pro. Solid machine, until it wasn‚Äôt. Around 18 months in, it needed repairs. Breville handled it, but the fix only lasted a while. Once it failed again, I was just a couple months outside the warranty, and they wouldn‚Äôt replace or repair it. They did offer a discount on a new machine. (I will say they have good customers service)

So I took a chance on the Oracle Jet. A $2,000 machine with a sleek new look and all the bells and whistles. I was genuinely excited.

But right out of the box? It was a total bust. The auto-tamp left a divot in the puck, so every shot extracted way too fast. Within four hours, I was boxing it back up and shipping it out.

Honestly, the biggest disappointment is that I‚Äôve been such a vocal advocate for Breville over the years. I believed in the brand, but after two machines failing and now this $2K flop, I can‚Äôt keep recommending them in good faith.

At this point, I‚Äôm likely going to go with a Lelit Bianca. I would spring for a La Marzocco, which we use exclusively at my  coffee house, but at $6K+ it‚Äôs hard to justify for home use.

Curious if anyone else has had issues with the Oracle Jet? Or thoughts on the Bianca vs. other options?

I need a double-shot to start the day, and, then, to manage caffeine withdrawal symptoms, I will have a decaf or two later in the day. As I've mentioned in previous comments, I started home brewing on a Breville BEX back in early 2020, but upgraded in 2022 to an E61 machine. I am now thinking about ditching the 5 1/2 year-old Breville (which I named, ""Neville""), and getting a second machine - one for home, one for office. I'm about to change jobs from one where I worked chiefly from home, to one where I'll be in-office most of the time. And the new office is not walking distance to any place where I can get a good one. I've already decided to take the Niche Zero as the Office Grinder because it's so delightfully quiet and so low-stress of a workflow. I'm going to try the new DF64v2 as its replacement at home. But the next question is, what machine? I can go over $1,000 - but I don't definitely don't want to spend $3,000. I am good anywhere in the middle. So some of my leading contenders included the LUCCA Tempo, and the LUCCA X58.

Here's what I'm wrestling with.

\-I want the capability to brew, steam, and dispense hot water on-demand. This rules out a machine like the LUCA SOLO.

\- I like E61 machines. I don't mind the heat-up time. I like how it's basically, ""on or off"", but does have a pressure ramp-up that approximates a quick pre-infusion. And I am reasonably proficient at manipulating brew profiles through recipe variables, without need manual flow control.

\- However, I am curious about flow control. I've always thought, ""a Lelit Bianca would be lovely."" And I would never insult the builder of my machine by installing any modifications. (He's convinced that they're not good for pump longevity). Still, the idea of being able to control water pressure to the brew group appeals to me. I'm not sure it's a must for an office machine. It might even be undesirable. I might want more limited features and simpler workflow, and not get lost in a world of other variables. But, then that tears at me because I already have an E61 machine, and if I'm getting a second, why shouldn't it add a brand new feature to play with?

\- What I really want for my next toy is a Flair, but, that's not a practical office option.

\- I don't need to be able to pull large numbers of back-to-back shots. Probably never more than 1 or 2 in a session. So, a small pump (my home machine, intentionally low-tech, has a 3-litre single boiler, no digital PID, analog pressurestat only, and a heat-exchanger - and weighs about 55 lbs.)

So, all of this has me leaning towards an X58, or perhaps a comparable Rocket or Lelit. A lower-powered, lower-priced, less-overbuilt, slightly higher-tech, and smart-looking E61.

Does anyone have any other thoughts? Or experience with any of the machines I've mentioned? Any suggestions for how I ought to analyze this?"

Then I sit down at my computer, in my PJ's, with a chocolate covered donut, blueberry muffin. Or, if I'm feeling¬†*extra*¬†bougee, a homemade almond-fondant-stuffed croissant.

Checking emails is so much more pleasant this way.

Don't get me wrong it has¬†*not*¬†always been this way for me, I have¬†**paid my dues,**¬†let me tell you. But once you get to where you are going, never feel guilty for enjoying the fruits of your labor. I certainly don't."

From what I understand, the recommended espresso range on the Encore ESP is #1‚Äì15, so I‚Äôm well outside that and not sure what‚Äôs going on. Is this normal for super fresh beans? Or is it a sign that something‚Äôs wrong with my grinder?

7,2025-07-15,Regular Libra vs 65 AP,u/kwill2k47,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m07sj7/regular_libra_vs_65_ap/,"I own both and thought I‚Äôd post this to help those deciding between the two. 

Here's a few differences:

Body/Aesthetics

- The body of the 65 and the 65 itself feels and looks a lot more premium. It feels like the back of a glass back iphone on the 65 vs a matte paint job on the regular where you can feel the paint. I have a black regular libra and a white 65 ap.

- The hopper looks and feels more premium on the 65 and has a metal tab vs a flimsy plastic one on the regular . The metal tab on the 65 moves perfectly horizontal with no wiggles, while the plastic one has a lot of give and wiggle. Not an issue for practical purposes, but the metal and the way it moves contributes to the more premium feel.

Burrs

- Grind times are slower with the AP burrs, but I do hear of some others who replaced it with espresso specific burrs with no issues and faster grind speed.

- For espresso, taste-wise I don't notice too much of a difference. To me they taste practically the same. Occasionally (not sure if it's in my head since I know the regular has espresso burrs), I do feel that the body/sweetness is thicker/higher on the regular libra burrs, but it's a subtle difference. I would say on occasion I notice higher clarity on the AP burrs.

- For filter, at least for my taste, the 65 is great for filter and doesn't clog the dripper with the right grind size. Overall, the ap burrs produce less fines than the regular burrs.

- If you like switching out burrs, the replacement burrs for the 65 are more premium, but are in the 130 range vs 40-100 range for the regular libra replacement burrs.  The replacement burrs for 65 AP are all black diamond and they have a light-med espresso burr, italian/dark espresso burr, AP burr, and filter burr. For the regular, as far as a I know, it has a filter burr, espresso burr, and diamond espresso burr.

Quality of life/Practical things

- The dial with a counter on the 65 and the metal tab is a god send if you switch between filter and espresso. For filter, on the 65 ap, I close off the hopper with the metal tab and what's left in the burr chamber is roughly 18-20grams so you can fully grind that out in continuous grinding mode. Then to adjust back, you run it in continuous grinding mode again and turn the dial back to espresso range and reopen the hopper to feed the beans back in. The stock burrs on the regular libra aren't the most suitable for filter and the plastic tab makes it harder to get through the beans to close off the hopper

- You can change out the dial on the regular libra to practically the same dial as the 65 ap. It's oem from Eureka and called King dial, but there's no counter on it.

- I zero pointed both grinders and they have identical dials minus the counter that's on the 65 ap. For some reason, when grinding for espresso, I'm on 1 or very close to the zero point on the regular libra vs 9-11 on the 65 ap. This could be because I bought the regular libra used, but I bought it from a reliable retailer (cliff & pebble's ebay store) and the description said it was only used for a month. Either way, between the two, it seems you can grind a lot finer on the 65 if need be.

- It's nice that the 65 comes with it's own catch cup for filter.

- In my experience, the 65 doses more accurately. It's almost always dead on or occasionally off by .1g. and doses the coffee out in one continuous grind. The regular is either spot on or off by .1-.2g and usually has a few more ""grind pumps"" where it'll grind out most of the dose then do a 1-2 short grinds to get to the accurate dose.

Overall, they‚Äôre both great grinders, but if choosing between the two new, I‚Äôd personally pay the $150ish more to get the 65. One thing nice about the regular is that there's a good number of used machines out there. You can occasionally find some on ebay for 390-400. "

A complete novice when it comes to using an espresso machine. I recently bought a Sage Bambino and having trouble with the output volume.

Also, the flow of shot itself seems a bit too watery. How to fix this?

I don't know much about machines, but I've been casually browsing discussions. I barely like anything at local cafes and it's too expensive to risk regularly. I've long outgrown my Delonghi de arte. I have a Baratza Encore ESP grinder.   
  
My understanding is, the more control and the more manual, the better? but there needs to be resources/how-to's available.

I have read the wiki and brewing basics guides but I am still a bit unclear on how to make changes to my yield output.

There‚Äôs a lot of talk about ratios and starting dose of beans to output yield, but the minute they start talking about adjustments, they only talk about how fast or slow the extraction time is, and not a lot about how to give more output volume.

I have a Breville Barista express and at the moment, I am getting the following results.

Bean type ‚Äì Blend (Brazil, Kenya & El Salvador)
Processing ‚Äì Natural & washed

19g dose grind setting at 5

Standard gentle pressure (uncalibrated) tamp ‚Äì as even as I can get

Using the pre-programmed double cup setting I get an output of 24g from 24 seconds extraction time (from the time I press the brew button until it stops)

When I add milk I am not unsatisfied with the taste, but my ideal goal is a higher yield closer to at least 38-40g

Gold standard would be to achieve a recipe close to the attached recipe from my favourite coffee shop.

I don‚Äôt want to over-engineer my morning routine, and if possible, through some basic adjustments, I‚Äôd like to use pre-set options if I can. In this case, would some experimenting with grind size adjustments help to increase my output yield?"

The lucca solo is an espresso-only single boiler e61 machine with optional flow control.  Of course, I went with the flow control.  I do not drink any milk drinks, so I didn't want or need a steam wand.  This may be a deal-breaker for most people, but i figured it's just one less thing that could potentially break or need maintenance.  Because there's no need for hardware to steam, the solo comes in a small package which is great since I don't have much space for another setup.  One of my favorite features is that you get ""soft preinfusion"" by lifting the brew lever about half way.  I've found i can achieve 2-3 bar pressure with this, without the pump being turned on.  Many e61s have this feature, but some need to be plumbed in to achieve any kind of pressure. Overall, I'm really happy with the solo and I'd recommend it to any espresso- only drinkers out there.  I do have a dreo baristamaker pro for milk in case I ever crave a milk drink, but it's mainly for my wife's lattes."

I'm looking to upgrade my current setup and would love your insights. We're replacing our De‚ÄôLonghi La Specialista semi-automatic machine, and are hoping to move towards something more manual. 

On a daily basis, we typically make 2-4 Americanos - weekly a handful of straight espressos, and occasionally a milk-based drink (a few times a month). I‚Äôve enjoyed playing with the settings and ‚Äúdialing in‚Äù my shots (as much as one can with a semi-automatic..), but I‚Äôm eager to continue improving the taste and quality of our shots. Ideally, I‚Äôd love to be able to land on a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù setup that minimizes fussing with the machine each time.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for:

- Electric grinder with hopper
- Manual machine with steam wand
- Fast heat-up time (We enjoy tea in the evenings, so quick access to hot water is essential.)

A nice to have would be preset settings for quick morning makes/ to be able to have dialled americano and espresso settings. 

We are hoping for a decent setup for at or under $1500 CAD, but there is a little wiggle room if it is necessary. 

I don‚Äôt think we need a double boiler as we very seldom make milk-based drinks, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions!

(A Caffeinated Adaptation)

'Twas the night before espresso, and all through the house,
Not a creature was stirring‚Äînot even my spouse.
The mugs were all nestled in cupboards with glee,
In hopes that a brew soon would cascade in thee.

The grinder was waiting beside the whole bean,
Asleep for now (gears waiting to spree).
My kettle stood quiet, no steam left to blow,
And visions of crema began their warm glow.

When out on the stoop there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the doorway I flew like a shot,
Tripping on slippers‚Äîhalf-dreaming, half-not.

The porch light did glisten on cardboard below,
With stickers that read: ‚ÄúThis Side Up‚ÄîEspresso!‚Äù
And what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a box full of joy‚Äîand delivery near.

With foam peanuts flying, so lively and quick,
I opened the flaps and felt slightly sick‚Äî
For there, in its splendor, all sleek and chrome-bright,
Was the machine I had researched forever each night.

More rapid than eagles, my thoughts they came,
As I whistled and shouted and called it by name:
‚ÄúNow steam wand! Now portafilter! Now pressure and gauge!
On tamping! On dosing! Let‚Äôs turn a new page!‚Äù

I carried it in with the utmost of care,
And cleared off the counter (with space now to spare).
The beans were lined up like proud little troops,
Single-origin soldiers, just waiting in groups.

I had prepared for this moment, YouTube vids,  front to the back.
Learned how to puck prep, temp surf it, and brew in a snap.
No water too hard, no grind too coarse‚Äî
This journey required both patience and force.

The night ticked away as I plotted and planned,
With visions of lattes just waiting, unmanned.
The joy of that hiss, the pressure-built thrill,
The morning would bring the first glorious fill.

Then I sprang into bed, heart buzzing with glee,
Tomorrow would start with espresso and me.
And I heard myself murmur, just soft as a beam‚Äî
‚ÄúHappy Brewing to all, and to all a bold steam!‚Äù

i'd say that this occurs once every 3-4 days and i haven't changed anything aside from feeding it RO water a year ago

any ideas on what might be causing this and how i can further diagnose?

thanks"

Would this actually be considered an upgrade? If it is, is it a good one? Or should I be looking into Brevilles or something. For reference, I value ease and that it‚Äôll taste as close to a local cafe latte because the whole point is to not buy coffee out so much üòÖ "

However, when using beans from medium to light roast, it difficult to reach the ""espresso range"" as shown on the pressure gauge. Instead, when I pull my shot it just stays within the pre-infusion range the entire time of the brew. I tried to grind finer but the built-in grinder on the machine is already at the finest setting. I also tried increasing the dose from 18g to 20g, but i still am not able to reach the espresso range. I want to start dialing in the coffee via measuring the yield and time, but I am having trouble even trying to pull a regular shot throughout the entire duration of the machine's preset time for a double shot. Any help or recommendation would be appreciated!

  
**Workflow**: I grind to atleast 18g or max 20g. I measure 18g/20g and put those beans in the hopper of the grinder. From there, I grind everything using the max grind settings (5 ticks past 0) into the 58mm bottomless portafilter with an IMS B702TCH24E basket till the hopper is empty. Then, I use a WDT tool to distribute. Then, I tamp with a self-leveling [MHW3 Tamper](https://mhw3bomber.com/products/cd-series-tamper-ripple-base?variant=45813177057418). From there i put in a puck screen and place it in the machine and press the brew button for pre-programmed double shot."

21,2025-07-16,Update: I bought a puck screen!,u/VictoriousFingolfin,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m1hdxw/update_i_bought_a_puck_screen/,"Hello, everyone! In my previous post on this subreddit, I shared [a photo of my clogged shower screen](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/s/wY68KNpwat), which was almost completely blocked by coffee residue. This resulted in very weak water flow. As a newbie, I didn't know I was supposed to clean this small part regularly. The problem was completely my fault. Many people blamed me for being negligent and inattentive, which is understandable. But many also tried to help me solve my problem, for which I'm genuinely thankful. 


Aside from instructions about cleaning my shower screen and performing backflushes on my machine, I was also informed about something called a puck screen. I hadn't heard of it before. This small component disperses water flow through the coffee grounds and, to some extent, prevents channelling. Moreover, it helps keep your shower screen clean after pulling a shot. 


Before buying a puck screen, when dialing in my shot, only a few drops would come out of my pressurized double basket. It was as if I had ground the beans too fine or something was blocking the water flow in the machine. But after buying and using this piece, I can pull consistent shots, and everything seems perfectly fine.


Long story short, I've found my puck screen very useful, and it has drastically improved the quality of my espresso shots. 


Big thanks to all the people who've helped me and didn't make fun of me for my ignorance :)‚ù§Ô∏è"

My grinder is an Eureka LIBRA and I use a Normcore V4.1 tamper. I‚Äôve been chasing consistency in my extractions, but I'm running into two recurring issues:

1. Noticeable side channeling, especially with lighter roasts
2. Lack of crema and body even when brew ratios and times are spot on

One thing I‚Äôve noticed: the tamper doesn‚Äôt seem to fully match the basket diameter. There's a slight gap between the tamper and the basket wall, which prevents the puck from being fully compressed at the edges. This leads me to believe that the water is preferentially channeling along the sides.

Has anyone else had this issue with the Normcore V4.1 and IMS baskets?

Could the tamper being slightly too small be enough to ruin an otherwise dialed-in shot? I‚Äôm wondering if a precision tamper (like 58.55 mm or 58.6 mm) would help, or if I should just switch to a different basket entirely.

Any suggestions on better tamper/basket combos for the Rocket R58? Or is there something else I might be overlooking? Thanks in advance!

3,2025-07-16,Machine modding,u/Radiant-Seaweed-4800,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m1kx33/machine_modding/,"Hello there!
In machine modding, computer controlled flow and pressure control seems to currently be a very hot topic.
With vibration pumps this can be done with a done by controlling it directly, with gear pumps it's basically their whole purpose, but for those of us with rotary pumps there doesn't appear to be a good solution yet. My idea to solve it: get a proportional valve. Proportional means that it's aperture closes/opens proportional to the applied voltage, thereby restricting flow proportionally to the applied voltage. Combined with a flow meter and a pressure probe, we can use a PID controller outputting a PWM signal to the valve, thereby controlling all we need to.

A suitable valve I found would be the B√ºrkert type 2873, running at around 150‚Ç¨. With probes and a controller we'd be at just over 200‚Ç¨ (roughly also 200$).

Did anyone try this, or something similar?

I had trouble dialing in a recent coffee so I decided to do a salami shot. But I couldn't be bothered to swap my cups out 4 times so I just pulled a 2:1 and pulled 1/2 into one and 1/2 into the next.

And it was incredibly insightful. Almost as insightful as using 4 cups but much easier and much more beginner friendly due to it's easier execution and clear delineation between the first and second halves of extraction. 

I'm definitely going to do this for the first shot of every new bag.

It was so helpful that I thought I'd make this post to spur people on to have a go if they are also having trouble dialing in.

Happy brewing,

As of the next use, it was clear I'd screwed up the plasma generator (fines flying¬†***everywhere,*** particularly towards the end). ¬†I cleaned it again and it briefly (five shots) solved the problem. However, it's back making a mess and it's threatening my social license to have the espresso equipment on the counter.

I've seen a few general videos around cleaning and replacing the piece. But, before I pull apart the entire machine and convince myself I need a new part, I wonder if others have had this problems and have a few recommendations?

With this, I am now in debates of if I should return the Encore ESP in favor of the SGP purely because of the automatic measuring tool. But at the same time, I've seen people say that for espresso, the machine is inconsistent (people have ran into grinding issues for any roast that isn't dark), and that the grinder motor has the tendency to give up often.

With this, as he relies more on the tech of automatic measuring, is the SGP worth it over an Encore ESP only for espresso, or is the Encore ESP so much better that the tech in the SGP simply isn't worth it?"

I purchased a new Profitec Move and DF54 about month ago and I am having difficulty dialling it in.

I can leave the df54 on the same setting, weigh the same amount of beans (21g in the double basket) and do the same puck prep (wdt only) and keep the same time (pre programmed 28 seconds) and get +/- 15-20g on the resulting shot.

I suppose the only variable in this sequence is my WDT technique but could it really have that much of an impact, especially when I am seemingly doing the same each time.

I had a BBP before and found much less variance shot to shot.

Can I blame the Profitec Move for inconsistency or is that highly unlikely?

As a person who loves coffee but always had nespresso machines I wanted to venture in the world of real espresso machines and learn more about the internal workings of this. So I bought a broken Isomac Giada second hand for 45 euros. The article stated that the machine leaked and the pump didn't work properly. After taking it apart piece by piece I replaced a number of parts like the group casket seal, the spring and the little ball, the temperature sensors, the steam pipe and the pump (this one came from another donor machine I bought).

I use a second hand Isomac Granmacinino for grinding and keep my fresh beans in a vacuum seal. 

The basket for the portafilter has a 14 gram grind hold but even on the finest setting, using proper tamping pressure I cannot get a shot that takes longer than 18\~ seconds. I weigh the beans with a scale and only grind the weighted beans. I also use WDT tool to break up the grind and evenly distribute it. I read something about testing the puck by putting it upside down and nothing falls down when I try this. 

The shot tastes pretty sour. I tried to grind finer, but the grinder is on the finest setting at the moment. I also tried to inceas the amount of beans to 18 grams, causing a longer shot but also the pump to lose pressure after a few seconds.

In terms of maintenance apart from replacing parts I descale the machine once every 3 months.

To be fair, the machine is about 20 years old (if not older) so I'm feeling it might also be due to the machine just being to old, but before I say goodbye I wanted to check if there are still things I might be missing.

I have just finally set up my espresso station.
I‚Äôll make a list of my equipment here:
- Delonghi Dedica EC685
- Fellow Opus conical burr grinder
- 51mm bottomless portafilter (IKAPE)
- 16-18g IMS precision basket (VeryBarista)
- IKAPE palm calibrated tamper, gravity distributor, dosing funnel
- WDT tool (just from amazon)
- Maestri house coffee scale

I am a complete beginner in this, so I ordered some dark-roasted beans off of Rave (roaster in the UK). They were roasted in the last week.
When trying to dial these in, I found that the espresso settings with a really fine grind on the Fellow Opus were not working out. The water did not pass through at all and had a little kitchen cleanup after (oops). 
Since I have read that the basket/portafilter size  I have is very uncommon, I tried fitting 16g of ground beans in it first which did not fit at all. Then, with a coarser grind, I went for 14g which seemed to fit quite well. I did get an extraction there, which went way too quickly and I was left with a watery puck.

I‚Äôll write down the steps that I have taken so any pro‚Äôs can see whatever I did wrong!
1. Weigh out 14g of beans
2. Give them a little spray with water out of a small spray bottle to reduce static
3. Into the grinder (approx around 3.7 on the Opus)
4. 14g of beans come out
5. Dosing funnel into the basket
6. WDT tool 
7. Gravity distributor on top
8. Tamp down
9. Flush the group head through first to warm everything up
10. Scale with coffee cup under the machine
11. Portafilter in
12. Double shot button on the machine but basically just trying to time it myself for now
13. At the same time, turned the timer on the scale on
14. Could not stop it on time because it extracted too quickly, 15s for 34g of coffee.

Any tips of what I should do? I don‚Äôt know if I should grind even coarser because it already extracts so quickly. Or should I try to grind more coffee, but it does not seem to fit in the basket? Completely new territory, so kind of lost here."

* I am using medium-roasted coffee beans.
* I'm using the manual way of pulling the shot (ie long press button to preinfuse, unpress to full pump, press again to stop)
* I use 18g of espresso. When tapped in, i check with the razor and from a volumetric point of view the puck is fine.
* With grind size:
   * < 18 the machine chokes and I dont get anything
   * At 18, I barely get around 20-25 g at 30-40 seconds
   * at 19 I get \~36g in 40''
   * at 20 it's too watery, I get 1:3 in <30''

My problems are:

1. My coffee is not *that* dark to need such a coarse setting. Baratza suggest 16 for espresso. If I want to grind something dark, I'll need to go into filter coffee grind settings.
2. More importantly, it gives very little room for experimentation/error. Normally, even 1 setting coarser/finer should make the cup undrinkable.
3. The shot is *fine* at 19, but since I drink this coffee often at my coffee shop, I know it's not at its best. However, with the grinder settings being so limited, I don't know how else I can experiment.

I would appreciate any help and advice because this thing is stressing me out :D "

i'd say that this occurs once every 3-4 days and i haven't changed anything aside from feeding it RO water a year ago

We have a breville barista pro that we love. However, We've been running the grinder at inner setting 6, outer setting 1 for a while and our beans are running too quickly. About 2:1 in 17-20 seconds, 19g basket. So I decided to change the inner burr setting to 4 so that we can get more play on grind size. After I did that, the grinder is set to outer setting 3-4 and still giving me a 17-20 second run time. I assumed that changing the inner burr 2 stops would sit me back in double digits for the outer setting. Tested with the same bag of beans. Medium roast. 

  
Espresso currently tastes fine but I have nothing to compare it to. Was hoping to achieve that 2:1 25-30 second baseline for comparison. 

Has anyone experienced this or have any fixes? Am I missing something? Or is changing the inner burr setting not as considerable as I assumed?

11,2025-07-17,Flair signature: Upgrade!,u/EasternMedicine5912,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m28opm/flair_signature_upgrade/,"Hi there,

  
Here is my complete setup-up. 

Shopping order is: bialetti moka pot + aeroccino.

Then got a used Dedica with a KG89 at a very low price (thanks my friend) in 2023 and quickly upgraded it to a Kingrinder K6 (2024) to start the my (real) espresso journey, with a non-pressurised basket. It was fun, but I got tired of handgrinding quickly and got a timemore 064's last month. It was a game changer. And now the Dedica obviously feels like the next upgrade.

Cups, timer, scale and other accessories are above on the shelf.

I recently had the opportunity to buy a used Flair signature (100‚Ç¨, what a bargain!), and added a PID to it. I haven't mastered it yet but it still performs very well, and it's very fun to use. The Flair Signature should help me avoid frustration with the Dedica, as I can adjust pressure and temperature precisely with the manual machine.

So... ...I am going to keep it all for now, because all of this stuff can be used either at home for convenience (Moka pot is super usefull when lot's of people are coming), K6 is easy to take on Holiday, and aeroccino is great for effortless cappuccino on Sunday morning with kids.  
I love where I am right now and am excited to use all this stuff and try lighter roast with the lever machine!

I'm not selling anything and I'm not looking to sell them but if you happen to have a 3D Printer that can print TPU or know someone that does, and you want a bellows for your zerno, this will save you the work of modeling one.

I tried finding one already modeled before I built this and couldn't find one.

I did do some testing and after grinding 20g of beans and then emptying the catch cup I used the bellows and did get a fair bit of additional coffee grinds out although I didn't measure it.  To me it's not about getting it all out or how much I get - but just getting that extra little bit.

I use a kingrinder k6. But will look to upgrade this as well. Looking around $500 range. Taking recos here too.

Gaggia classic pro or evo seems to be a great step up. But I‚Äôm not too interested in modding at least for now. That could change though. Would it work sufficiently out of the box or the upgrades are really necessary. 

Lelit Anna is tempting as well. More ready to go out of the box. Will this be the machine for me.

I love straight espresso, but my wife is purely lattes so I want to make sure her drinks do not suffer too much when I make the switch. Surprisingly I can find little to no info about a turbo shots interaction with milk, so any info would be great!

I understand that the standard definition of a ristretto shot is a 1:1 ratio (as opposed to a 1:2 ratio of a standard shot) of input/output in around the same time as a standard shot. If you try to dial in your roast for a normal shot, then try to dial in the roast for a ristretto shot, can you find multiple peaks to this curve? Does this imply there's some repeated peak around certain intervals of time, as if it's a resonant frequency of espresso making?"

I have a Profitec Go and Niche Zero, using fresh med/dark beans. 

Ive been on this issue of never getting tasty espresso, I would start slight coarse and then extend the ratio and fine things up but I find I go from sour to 'balanced' but bland and then if I go finer to bring our more flavor it just tastes....odd, I never get like solid coffee taste or go heavy into bitter. I let the machine warm up for like 10-15 min and the PID is saying it's at temp ( Ive even adjusted the E1 offset up to 18 from other thread advice). but can never land tasty espresso. I recently went to a friend with a Brevile and they gave me a shot after almost no warmup time that was solid although a bit bitter and burnt and I realized I was never even get close to pushing the extraction that hard as to get that flavor out.

I had recently left the machine on for over an hour on the weekend cause I got distracted and noticed the shot I pulled, while not dialed, was HOT to touch (like noticeable hotter than normal ) and much different in flavor. Am I just not letting the machine warm enough??? I just ordered some smart plugs to try and turn the machine on an hour before I wake up in morning to see if this helps.

I kinda feel dumb Ive been at this forever and feel Ive been running circles trying to dial in with a cold machine and so confused why following typical dialing advice never quite landed,"

I don‚Äôt really want to become the default barista every time someone wants a latte, so I'm hoping for something that has the capability to be used both manually and semi-automatically for beginners. Most people here go for milk-based drinks like lattes or cappuccinos, though there‚Äôs the occasional straight espresso or Americano for me.

Right now, I‚Äôm leaning toward the Bambino Plus. It‚Äôs compact, heats up quickly, and has automatic milk frothing, which would make it easy for everyone to use. 

I have the regular Bambino at home and it gets the job done, but since the office is covering the cost, I‚Äôm wondering if there are any other options out there that would offer a better experience, especially for multiple users throughout the day. We‚Äôd be making maybe 5‚Äì10 drinks daily, not back-to-back. 

Counter space is a little tight, so smaller machines are preferred. I‚Äôm planning to pair it with a hoppered mid-range grinder like the Sette 270 (non-Wi or Wi), or Eureka Mignon.

I've loved having espresso and lattes in the morning when I wake up but I've always wished that we had a normal espresso machine so I can get a better quality drink. I like getting espresso from my local shop and our home machine just never has the same flavor as the shop. It has always tasted watered down or acidic to me, even with the same beans.

|Location|Greenville SC|
|Preferred drink types|Espresso and lattes. I'd also like to make sugary drinks for my partner though too|
|Drink frequency|Every morning and sometimes several in a row for guests|
|Space|EXTREMELY limited countertop space. Maybe the size of 3 small stove tops.|
|Experience level|Brand new to espresso making|
|Manual or electric|hand grinder for sure to save space and money. Id like to get an electric espresso machine though, I don't like the manual ones very much.|

Here are the items I currently have in my cart and my explanation for picking each. 

Espresso Machine: CASABREWS CM5418 

From what I've seen online this might be one of the few espresso machines I can afford that still preforms decently. I would look into used machines but I am somewhat distrustful of used kitchen appliances since I don't believe enough people do the preventative maintenance required of most of them, let alone regular cleaning(please for the love of god clean your dishwasher filter). 

Grinder: KINGridner P2

This is probably the item on my list I have gone back and forth on the most. I know I will need a hand grinder to both save money and countertop space but finding one that works well and that doesn't make my wallet cry has been hard. I landed on this one because my friend got one and said he has been using it to make espresso to much success. But, lots of posts online go back and forth on if this is a grinder capable of making fine enough grounds for espresso. I'd be fine for springing for something like the K1 since it's not too much more but at my budget every little bit matters. So if its not completely necessary I'm fine dealing with the cheaper quality of the P2. I plan of upgrading later anyway when I have maybe another $150 to just drop on a good hand grinder.

Portafilter: CAPFEI 51mm Bottomless Portafilter

Many people online I've seen talk about the Casabrews cm5418 have said the first thing you should do is buy a new portafilter. This is one of the few I could find that guarantees fits into the cm5418 and I plan on getting a different basket anyway. I asked normcore support if their portafilter would fit but they said they only guarantee it to fit in certain models of espresso machine. I haven't seen much about CAPFEI or if they are reliable though

Basket: Normcore 51mm High Extraction Filter Basket, 16-18g

I tried to look at as many normcore things as I could since they seem to have a consistent quality and good price. I don't know if this will fit in my portafilter but I don't know any reason it wouldn't since it's still 51mm. I also wanted something that could fit 18g of grounds since I plan on making 40g of espresso for each latte. I know that's not exactly 1:2 but I'm hoping deviating from that won't cause too much trouble. Also it comes with a puck screen and that's savings baby.

Distribution method: Normcore 51mm 2-in-1 Magnetic Dosing Cup

I watched WAY too many videos breaking down the different distribution methods of espresso grounds and even found myself reading some papers and graphs. From what I've seen using a blind shaker like this and then just knocking the side of the portafilter to even things out should work pretty well for me. I have thought about adding one of those spinning distributors to my list but I have chosen to leave out the WDT entirely.  

Tamper: Normcore 51mm Coffee Tamper V4.1

The main thing I was worried about with tamping is making sure it's level. I do not trust myself to just tamp it level so I wanted one that self leveled, the click when I hit a certain pressure is just a cool bonus to me. Again I am still trying to go with normcore since that's what I trusted from people recommending brands online.

Scale: Coffee Scale with Timer, Kitchen, Digital, Rechargeable, Glass Mirror Design, for Pour-Over Barista, 0.3-3000g/0.1g

It is literally just one of the cheapest scales with a timer on it I could find on amazon. It seems accurate enough but I'm not married to this one at all. 

Milk Frothing Pitcher: CASABREWS CASMP350 Milk Frothing Pitcher

It seemed like most pitchers were around $10 on amazon so I thought why not just get one that's the same brand as the machine? I don't think this actually matters too much.

Atomizer: Fusupak Perfume Atomizer

Just a cute bottle to spray my grounds. I see it in tiktoks a lot when they make espresso. I know it reduces static but I don't know if I actually need to spray the beans or if any couple drops of water would work just as well. 

All together it adds up to about $336. The things I'm most concerned about is anything I might be buying that I don't really need and if my grinder is truly good enough for espresso. I have a roaster in my area I trust to get good beans and I'll be mostly getting a dark roast so I think that should help me have an easier time dialing in my setup. I'm just looking for some criticism about what I've chosen and if there might be anything I'm missing or don't know about because of inexperience. Thanks guys!"
1,2025-07-17,Single Dose Espresso Grinder upgrade from Breville Barista Pro [$1000-1500],u/brandonWRX,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m2n5ti/single_dose_espresso_grinder_upgrade_from/,"
Hi all

Thanks to the community for 2 years of searching and lurking which has made my espresso much much better. Been happy with my Breville Barista Pro and as I navigate to light / medium roasts I am finding the grinder less capable and often the roasters will ask what grinder and kinda give a disclaimer to stick with some South American varieties due to the density and point me away from some of the lighter roasts / African varieties. 

Been getting beans from Toronto   üá®üá¶ & surrounding area roasters like Social Coffee, Detour, Hatch & De Mello and really like some of the lighter and Ethiopian varieties. I can get close to some notes if they are roasted for espresso but if not then they aren‚Äôt that great. 

I drink usually milk based cortados or lattes and prefer mixing up trying different beans and experience different notes and stay away from dark roasts. My wife likes ice lattes and likes more traditional / stronger / bolder. So I have been single dosing the Breville and it isn‚Äôt horrible.

So been doing a ton of reading a YouTube watching and next to the quality / freshness of the roast the grinder is next and didn‚Äôt want to do a tiny step up but something that I can use with my breville until I eventually upgrade the machine where that grinder will be still useful.

I am also torn between the flat vs conical since I like the lighter / med roasts. My wife says hers taste great with the built in grinder so maybe I go flat for just myself but also saw some of the flats create particles like a conical. So I am torn. The clarity vs body of the flat vs conical is something I am interested in tasting as a side by side comparison somewhere.  

Anyways the 3 that I am thinking about are:

1) Niche Zero
- I like its relatively quiet compared to others and heard great reviews on here by owners. 
- the reviews of the Duo kinda seem not worth it where videos show particles are same as the zero 
- I don‚Äôt like the customs / import fees and the unknown but from others in my area it looks like $1200 Canadian 
- there are used ones that pop up for 950ish from time to time but I don‚Äôt want to gamble for $200 if they weren‚Äôt treated well or broken. 

2) Mazzer Philos
- looks great and has great reviews
- it‚Äôs about about $700 than the niche here in Canada at about $1750 Canadian plus tax. 

3) DF83V 
- bit cheaper and 83 mm burrs.
- some mention build quality isn‚Äôt as good but lots of ways to customize 


I kinda ruled out DF64 v2 due to posts I have been about quality and configuration.

Also ruled out timemore 64s as I have seen a lot of people who sold it to go to niche and much happier. 


Would appreciate any feedback or recommendations of grinders $1000-1500 Canadian range that will last me through my Breville and my eventual upgrade to a new machine down the road or even swap to a Breville bambino for the counter space but that‚Äôs a whole new post :) but I like the looks of Rocket Apartmento and Lelit and if I win the lottery a Linea :) 

Thanks for taking the time. "

I‚Äôve been trying to dial in on my Breville Barista Touch for what feels like forever. When I first got it, I got super lucky ‚Äî stock grind settings and beans gave me great results out of the box. I didn‚Äôt change anything for months.

Then one day, everything stopped working. Since then, I‚Äôve been trying to fix it off and on for a while ‚Äî and over the past few days, I‚Äôve probably spent at least 15 hours making concentrated efforts to dial it in. I haven‚Äôt gotten a single good shot out of it since.

I‚Äôve tried:
‚Ä¢ Grind settings from 9 to 15
‚Ä¢ Set the inner burr to 5
‚Ä¢ Dosing anywhere from 17.5g to 18.5g
‚Ä¢ Outputs from 32g to 37g
‚Ä¢ Shot times ranging from 19s to 35s
‚Ä¢ Using WDT, tamping, and distributor. Also tried skipping WDT and/or distributor to rule out over-prepping ‚Äî no change.

No matter what I do, the shot ends up either sour, thin, bitter, or just flat. Any time I get close, the tiniest adjustment throws it way off again.

More details per the posting guide:
‚Ä¢ Taste: Usually flat, a little sour, sometimes watery. Never sweet, never balanced. Even with milk and syrup it tastes thin or weirdly sharp.
‚Ä¢ Roast date: About 3 weeks off roast
‚Ä¢ Roaster: Counter Culture
‚Ä¢ Roast level: Medium-dark (mostly Big Trouble, now using Forty-Six)
‚Ä¢ Bean details: Blend, not single origin
‚Ä¢ Dose: 17.5‚Äì18.5g, mostly trying to stay at 18g
‚Ä¢ Yield: 32g‚Äì37g tested. Aiming for 36g then tried for 32g to see if it helped, went back to 36g when it didn‚Äôt. 
‚Ä¢ Time: Typically starts flowing around 10s, ends between 22‚Äì27s. Faster than I want, but if I go finer the shot tastes incredibly sour.
‚Ä¢ Workflow: Weigh dose, WDT, level, tamp flat and firm. Portafilter shows mostly even flow, relatively honey-like, but sometimes gushing and blonde near and. Tried a few shots with no WDT or distributor just to check, and it made no difference.

I don‚Äôt see how it couldn‚Äôt be something I‚Äôm doing, but at this point I genuinely don‚Äôt know what it is or how this could be this difficult. Please help!!"

As for temperature, I understand that the ideal brewing temperature is 93¬∞C. But once we press the button and water starts flowing through the portafilter, isn't that the point of no return? So even if the machine has a PID, what can we actually do to control it at the moment?"

I got a krups precision XP801T10, I do think I have a good result but I feel I'm missing something, here are some details:

With no pressurized cup (2cups size), no matter the quantity or the grinding level (even 1), it's very watery, no pressure at all, the pressure meter doesn't even budge!

I tried double wall, and there .. finally was able to get the pressure in the correct pressure zone. I can't though add up more pressure if I want:

1. I am already on level 1 grinding. I use the maximum of the portafilter (which is 18g).
2. What I get from it, yield can goes up to 60g+ but I stop it way earlier to get around 36-44g yield.
3. With 5 seconds pre-infusion, I stop at 26 seconds for around 44g yield.

From my readings, videos I watched, that's not optimal!! I have good pressure according to the machine, but I don't get the yield between 25-30 seconds as it's recommended!

I can't add up more coffee and I can't get more pressure by grinding less...

  
Is that machine limitations? or am I an idiot? :D

I use medium coffee and not very expensive as I'm still learning, so kind of wasting a lot of coffee :D"

Started with [Coffeegeek.com](http://Coffeegeek.com), Chris Coffee. Isomac then a plumbed in Vetrano 20 years ago. Mazzer Mini with doser. At the time the doserless idea was just starting. But I liked grinding for multiple shots for family and friends so I stuck with the doser. My technique was a palmful of beans per shot. Add beans to portafilter. Level off with my finger. Manual tamp to 30lb, using a bathroom  scale to understand tamping  pressure. Almost always the top of the piston on my Espresso Parts tamper would be even with the top of the basket. Looked for a 20-25 second 2 oz pull. Interestingly, Jim from 1st Line seems to do this even today. 

Big debate at the time on Coffee Geek forums was flat or curved bottom. I wasn't sure and settled on a slightly convex one. I was making the best espresso anyone I knew ever had with a few varieties of beans from Paradise roasters or Nizza Lacolombe, from Phila area where I am. 

Fast forward. Vetrano fails after 18 years. And I have been watching Hoffman and Hendrik on youtube. 

New Vetrano, Niche Zero. So I get a scale to weigh my 18g. Normcore leveling tamper. WDT. Aiming for the 1:2  ratio 25-30 second shot. 

After a few weeks, I am not so sure that all this matters for a nice tasty shot straight or with some steamed milk cortado volume for my wife. 

I think the doser shakes up the finely ground coffee enough so that WDT isn't needed. And eyeballing 2 oz pulls still tastes great. 

I advocate a return to qualitative simplicity. That's what I am calling this method.  "

As a new project I recently bought a used Pavoni Domus Bar. I disassembled and cleaned, including the built-in grinder (should be identical to the grinder in the Anita PL042 and the standalone grinder PL043). When I wanted to reassembling everything, I noticed something strange:

For the factory reset of the grinder, the upper burr needs to be screw down clockwise.

Now:
When I turn the outer grind adjustment knob toward ‚ÄúCoarse‚Äù, the upper burr rotates clockwise, which actually brings it closer to the lower burr.
As a result, the grind becomes finer, not coarser as expected.

This seems to completely reverse the expected behavior ‚Äî turning toward ‚ÄúCoarse‚Äù should increase the distance between the burrs and make the grind coarser, not finer.

What also irritates me: the manual states that 
> Choose higher degrees to get coarse-ground coffee or smaller degrees to get fine-ground coffee.

Attached a drawing of how the movement of the knob moves the bean housing

I‚Äôm wondering:
Did I reassemble the adjustment mechanism incorrectly?
Do I have a wrong understanding how the grinder should work? 
Could the thread/spindle or knob coupling be reversed?

Has anyone experienced this?
Any insight or some check how your grinder turns if you use the knob would be super helpful. Thanks!

I have had this machine for a few weeks now, and I have noticed, that pressure indicator needle never goes beyond level you can see in the picture.

I was just performing cleaning cycle with cleaning tablet and silicon pad in the portafilter, and as you can see, presure goes to center of the scale and no more. As far as I know, the pressure should build up with the basket resistance; no resistance means no pressure, and max resistance means max pressure. Right now, with my silicon pad, there's no water drip down from portafilter, so there's max resistance and still half pressure.

Every YouTube video I saw on cleaning cycle the barista express shows indicator go to the very right.

Should I be worried? Does that mean my machine is malfunctioning? Does that affect coffee I make? Is there a solution for that?

I've just started blogging around coffee topics. My first post is focusing around decaf coffee, how it is made and how it evolved. It is inspired and partially based on [James Hoffman's videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=james+hoffmann+decaf) but also many other interesting sources I found.

I'd be super interested to:

* understand if this is reading material you enjoy
* get input for topics you would be interested in for next articles
* start discussion on your favorite decaf beans (would add your favorites to the summary at the end of the blog).

I have disabled the comment section on my blog, because I would love to foster the discussion around it here on reddit if it is of interest.

**Introduction: The Rise of Quality Decaf**

Decaf coffee was once scoffed at by coffee purists, but attitudes are changing. An increasing number of quality-focused coffee drinkers are embracing¬†**espresso without caffeine**¬†in pursuit of great flavor minus the jitters. In fact, younger generations (Gen Z and Millennials) are driving a decaf renaissance, often choosing decaf to reduce anxiety and improve sleep without sacrificing their coffee ritual. Specialty coffee experts like¬†James Hoffmann¬†note that¬†*‚Äúculture is shifting‚Äù*¬†\-¬†decaf is no longer seen as ‚Äú*not real coffee*,‚Äù and modern decaf can be a delicious option that doesn‚Äôt feel like a compromise. High-end roasters now apply the same craftsmanship to decaf beans as they do to regular beans, meaning you can enjoy rich coffee flavor with minimal caffeine. In this context, it‚Äôs no surprise that interest in¬†**decaf coffee process**¬†and quality has surged among home baristas and coffee connoisseurs.

I‚Äôve been into home coffee making for about 2 years now. I‚Äôve been using a **DeLonghi Dedica** espresso machine along with a **Baratza Encore** grinder.

A couple of months ago, the Baratza gave out, and I took that as a sign to upgrade. After some research, I picked up a **Turin D64 grinder**‚Äîand I absolutely love it!

Now, onto the espresso machine. The Dedica still works, but my biggest issue is the **steam wand**‚ÄîI really hate it. I looked into some modding tutorials, but they require opening the machine up and doing too much DIY, which I‚Äôd rather avoid.

# What I‚Äôm Looking For:

So now I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs time to upgrade the espresso machine. Since I already have the Turin D64 grinder, I‚Äôd prefer to **get a machine without a built-in grinder**. Does that make sense, or am I limiting myself too much by going that route?

I mostly make **Lattes or Iced Whites**, so good milk steaming is pretty important to me. I don‚Äôt really have complaints about the espresso extraction on the Dedica, so I‚Äôm not sure what kind of upgrade I‚Äôd need there‚Äîbut the **milk frothing experience definitely needs to improve**.

I‚Äôm okay with spending **2x to 2.5x the price of the Dedica**.

Let's talk flow control.
Not the paddle kind, but the kind which lets you set your flow over the entirety of the shot in a chart, and the machine executes your wishes.
Currently, it is only possible with vibratory pumps, gear pumps or manually with the paddle.

While these options work, they have downsides.
Vibe pumps are noisy, gear pumps are expensive.
Why not upgrade our machines which have rotary pumps?
In theory it is easy, we need a specific valve, a microcontroller and a few sensors. The valve can replace the solenoid most machines already have, so it won't use any more room, the sensors are tiny anyways.

Now to my question: would there be any interest in an off the shelf, plug and play solution?
It would be as easy as opening two threads and screwing the new assembly in.
This would offer the ability to use pressure or flow profiling, and offer monitoring abilities as well. One could even connect bluetooth scales to have the ability to stop on weight.

Hi. I'm an occasional espresso drinker who primarily drinks filter. 90% of my daily brews are filter. I was using the Breville SGP for the past five years for this, however, my SGP outer burr broke so I'm looking for an upgrade. I live in Pakistan and the only two options I have available locally are the Mahlkonig X54 and the Fellow ODE2. I know the Fellow isn't capable enough for espresso. Will the Mahlkonig work for great filter? Buying from abroad is a hassle I'm trying not to get into because we have awful customs.  "

The taste difference is immediate and significant. 

If you arent really paying attention to puck prep, do yourself a huge favor and spend $20 on a wdt and add 15 seconds to your workflow to prep with it. Its an absolute game changer in improving my shots in an area that I didnt even realize i needed to improve."

\- Large iced coffee with vanilla sweet cream cold foam (preferably with Starbucks beans or equivalent)

\- Latte (medium roast beans)

\- Occasional plain Espresso shot

\- Occasional hot coffee

The primary criteria are:

1) drinks taste better than Starbucks.

2) relatively simple to make. I've seen some superautomatic machines that look compelling, and taking less counter space would be nice, but this isn't an absolute must. However, ease of use is very important. She wants to be able to get her coffee made quickly, make the cold foam, and be done with it. No pour over, aeropress, etc. for the iced coffee. I'm fine making my latte. We used to use a Breville Barista Express and it made okay drinks for a few years but even with routine cleanings it became very mediocre. I've tried to troubleshoot various things but it's never returned to it's original form.

3) Absolute top of budget is \~$3K but I'm fairly certain we can spend less than that and achieve our goals and I'd be much happier spending less. From my limited research it seems like I should be able to get a solid latte without breaking the bank."

While I don't mind the noise, I am getting kind of tired of having to do it as much as it takes to get to near zero retention. I love the grinder all in all, it's served me really well, but I got the green light to go shopping and so here I am, asking all of you for your recs (**preferably based on your actual experience**).¬†

I can't see spending more than $1500 and would love to keep it under $1k if possible. I need a well-reputed single dose grinder that can achieve very low to zero retention without the use of bellows that is as silent or nearly as silent as my Silenzio.

I've always had my eye on the Lagom P64 but seeing the trend of Option O's grinders, I wonder if this one is missing some type of knocker to get the last of the grounds/fines out and is just due for an update. I am open to it if owners can say that the retention is so low that it hasn't necessitated any type of knocker like on their other models.

Others I'm considering: 

* **Timemore 064s or 078s** (I don't RDT, but how annoying is the hopper issue? Also, how loud is the clicker on the fines collector?) 
* **Gevi VelPro** \- because why not, it's at least a grinder I can get my hands on and possibly return thru Amazon 
* **Mahlkonig x64sd** \- look really promising
* **Lagom Casa** \- I don't know a lot about this one but it seems well priced, has Option O's quality and has low retention in mind.
* **Niche** \- I don't love the look, but it's been beloved for so long by so many
* **Zerno** \- I know it's a delay to get it, but could justify the wait if it is really my best option

  
Any others that I'm missing that fit the bill that you've had good experience with (or bad so I know to stay away)?

I‚Äôm using a brand new Eureka Mignon Zero with a Gaggia Classic Evo Pro, and I‚Äôm having trouble getting fine enough for espresso ‚Äî especially with decaf.

But also with normal beans, I‚Äôm grinding very close to zero to get a decent shot time. So I basically have no wiggle room left.

Is this: 
‚Ä¢	Normal for the Mignon Zero? 
‚Ä¢	A sign of burr misalignment?

For now I can say that I am positively surprised about the heft and apparent build quality. The H4C has replaceable batteries and makes a solid first impression. I ordered the machine with the barista pro kit, which includes a 51mm basket, stand, dosing funnel, a small but solid tamper and a pretty decent WDT tool.

The machine also has a back pressure of 4 bar (w/o portafilter). 

Steps I have taken so far: 

1. I have cleaned the OPV, it looks good so far. However, I cannot rule out the possibility that it is not working and have ordered a new one to be on the safe side, which I have not yet tried out.

2) I have removed and cleaned the brew group (Faema E61). The shower manifold and the upper and middle valves were replaced.

3.I installed the solenoid valve from another (working) machine. This made no difference.

My next step would now be to replace the pump, which I haven't done yet because it sounded good and the pressure was also built up stably. If there is no change with the new one, I would replace the OPV.

Does anyone have any idea what the problem could be? I would be grateful for any suggestions :)

I'm having trouble dialing in my espresso machine and not sure where I'm going wrong. I've been going based off the brew times but maybe I should be weighing instead. This is the data I've done and it seems whenever I tweak something I get further confused. 

Internal burr setting - 6 (default)

Pull 1 - grinder setting 7
18g dose
12 seconds from starting brew to reaching pressure and starting to extract
19 seconds of extraction
Total time 31 seconds
Result 50g espresso

Pull 2 - grinder setting 5
18g dose
14 seconds from starting brew to reaching pressure and starting to extract
24 seconds of extraction
Total time 38 seconds
Result 55g espresso

Going off of the instructions pull 1 indicated needing a finer grind to reduce the amount of espresso but pull 2 indicates needing it more coarse based on the total time. To have even more confusion the second pull resulted in even more espresso even with a finer grind. 

Any help would be appreciated "

[Breville Bambino, KinGrinder K6]",u/eddeghs,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m3ioxa/is_it_essential_to_fully_lock_off_your/,"Hey guys, fully new to the espresso game. Just a few days! Having lots of fun at the moment but also some frustration. There's a multitude of issues to work through but I have one particular question for the Bambino users here.

I'm using stock equipment for the time being with the single wall double shot basket + fresh roasted beans. The issue I'm having is that when I fully lock off my portafilter it skews slightly to the right of centre. The photo taken I've tried to centre the camera as much as possible.

Yesterday I had a pretty awesome pull but when I tried it again today with basically the same settings I had a few drops of espresso max. Like I said, there are a few things I can think of as points of difference but one of them was that I didn't max out the portafilter lock today. It was tight but not all the way.

I've looked online at videos from Breville and other YouTubers and their portafilter handles are almost always centre, I saw a couple left of centre but never right of centre. My questions are:

1. Is this normal?
2. Does anyone else's machine do this?
3. Is locking it to the maximum range going to affect my pull? 
4. (bonus question) If I do an under extraction of a few drops, what will running another shot with the same cake loaded into the machine do to the coffee/machine? I did that today because I was short of time and it just shot out mostly coffee minimal Crema. But does doing this have negative effects?

I'm just trying to approach every possibility without using all the beans in the kingdom.

Thanks in advance! In my short time here I've found this sub and community to be one of the kindest, most welcoming and fairest communities out there. Keep bean cool!"

I bought a Kingrinder K6 and a bottomless portafilter for my cheap DeLonghi machine. I‚Äôm using supermarket coffee that's labeled as medium roast, but it seems much darker in practice.

Here‚Äôs my current recipe:

* Dose: 14g in
* Yield: 28g out
* Time: 25 seconds

The coffee looks decent with a thick, hazel brown crema but the taste is bitter and unpleasant. I'm trying to figure out whether the bitterness comes from overextraction, and how I can fix it.

I'm considering two options to reduce the bitterness:

1. Finer grind: Reduce grind size so that I get less yield in the same 25 seconds (1:1.5 ratio instead of 1:2).
2. Shorter shot: Keep everything the same but stop the shot earlier, maybe at 20 seconds to reach the same ratio.

I'm leaning toward option 2, because I suspect reducing the grind size might worsen the overextraction. But I‚Äôm not sure.

A few extra details:

* Water temp is unknown, since it‚Äôs a basic machine.
* I tamp evenly, and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs channeling (based on what I see from the bottomless portafilter).
* No preinfusion is used.
* Puck prep is WDT, leveller, tamp.

Does anyone here have advice on which adjustment works better with dark roast coffee? Shorter time or finer grind? Or should I be changing something else entirely?

I got myself a Sage Barista Express a few weeks back and have been using the remains of some crappy old dark roast super market beans. For these I had the internal bur set to 2 and the outer wheel set to 4, that worked fairly well.

I just bought myself some lovely beans from a local roaster, they‚Äôre washed medium roast beans. I dropped some into the hopper and went to grind them, a few beans were ground however the grinder immediately jammed. I had to remove the hopper and suck out the remaining beans with a vacuum to clear it.

I assumed i was grinding too fine, so I adjusted the internal bur to 4 and changed the outer wheel to 10. It ground to a halt and jammed almost immediately.

Tried some more of the old beans, and they went through just fine. Then tried the new beans through a friends stand alone grinder, which did grind them however they had somewhat of a popcorn effect in the hopper, constantly pinging around.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Does anyone have any advice for me?"

Grind, stir with wdt, ramp, razor. 

The guage went to absolutely bang on the middle of the extraction range. Then nothing came out of the portafilter. 

Waited a minute and tried again. Got some flow but not much. 

For the next shot I reduced the grind size by a couple of clicks & didn't tamp as hard but again perfect pressure with no flow. 

Previous experience if the puck was to fine or tamped down hard enough to clog the guage would also be off the scale.

It's a very large machine to make the equivalent of single drop coffee cups with extra steps. These are made by a lot of different companies on Amazon. They are all the same machine. This is not worth buying. The reviews on Amazon are great, as they always are. The reviews don't actually mean anything because they are generated by bots and the companies themselves.

Can the P-64 with Mizen 64 Omni 'replicate' the Niche Zero's strengths if I increase the RPM to generate more fines?

6,2025-07-19,Making an open source Lever Espresso Machine,u/ayushsuman_,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m3w7k7/making_an_open_source_lever_espresso_machine/,"So, I sometimes do coffee pop ups, where it's difficult to carry an espresso machine due to technical limitations. So I was looking for some options for manual lever espresso machine, like Flair. Most of them are pretty good, but I feel there is lack of standardisation in the options available.  
  
For a simple non-electric mechanical machine, the prices are very inflated, I guess because getting a lever espresso machine is generally passion driven purchase. I mean on one hand, we have stuff like Aeropress, which is simple, highly customisable, gives great level of control, and is so affordable. And then we have all these lever espresso machines, priced unreasonably high for a piston, lever and a group head, and almost all the options would lack customisability. If you want more features, you buy their premium models. So I am designing my own Lever espresso machine, in Fusion 360. The goal is to have the following features -   

1. **Piston Mounts** \- The piston, that pushes the water out at 6-9 bar of pressure, be either customisable (or replaceable). For example, one of the mounts can, with the use of hydraulics, multiply the pressure by 2. So if you use that mount, you will have the press longer, but for the same force applied, you might have twice the output pressure. Some other mount might have a spring attached, which softens the pressure applied, giving smooth or delayed pressure output. This way, with the use of different piston mounts, people can customise the pressure output.
2. **Choice of pressure guage** \- I would personally be building a small digital module that connects to my phone and let me visualise the pressure profile (pressure applied over time during a single press), so that I can practice different styles, but someone else might want to have a simple traditional pressure guage connected to their press. The idea is to have a place/hole where pressure guage can be mounted, and the community can choose what device they want to use. Options are limitless.
3. **Should be compatible with standard 58mm portafilter** \- I know there is no standard when it comes to portafilter, and we can't account for all types of portafilters, but I don't want to have some crazy design here that limits the type of portafilter to those of very specific styles. 
4. **Lever position lock** \- Not that important for customisation, but it is a feature I want to have. Having an easy way to lock and unlock the lever angle.
5. **It should be simple yet beautiful** \- I always appreciate the simplicity of a french press, pour overs or an Aeropress. Some lever espresso machines too are simple, but some like Flair lose their charm with their (I don't know how to put it otherwise) - lack of simplicity in their design. Also, I want to clarify, by this, I don't mean that I want this design to be lacking in functionality. If a complicated gear system does a really good job in giving a really really good UX, it should be a part of the design, but it should not lock people out of options/customisability where it might be important. 

The thing is - I ABSOLUTELY SUCK at Fusion 360. Because I have never used it in my life. And I am an electronics engg grad, but am absolutely clueless when it comes to the jargons used in mechanical engg. So sometimes, I am stuck because I don't know how to search for the kind of solution I want to implement.   
  
So, this is where I need the community to step in. I would love if you all, coffee nerds (and possibly design geniuses) can help me here, making the dream lever espresso machine, so that anyone can use the design, or take inspiration from it, and manufacture it locally.

I recently bough a cafelateRobot machine (barista) along with a Nero Niche grinder. Now, I had some decent shot with my previous espresso machine.... but now... help !! :(

I use medium-dark cofee beans and I have been trying alot of grinder size (from up to 16 down to below 10).

Everytime, I try to make the pre-extraction (2 bar, around 3-4sec) then I aim for 8 bars for the shot.

When grind is below 10, it feels like it is clugged and I cannot get the shot going, or I need to apply alot of force for it to come. It taste very bad thought after (I guess it is over extracted?)

When I am around 15-16, it comes in very smoothly, but it still taste very bad.

I tryed around 13, then it was better in term of extraction time and overall pressure during the shot. The colour looks more ""standard"" also... still taste awfull.

I would greatly appreciate advice.

Just to mention I do not make use of the paper filter, only the metallic filter in the holder. I use around 18 for my shot (anywhere from 17.8 to 18.8).

I press it gently but firmly (I checked after with my finger and it feels firm to the touch). Thanks in advance!"

I am looking for the best machine/grinder combo in the $1000-$1500 range. The goal is to have a reliable set up to replace the >$60 a week currently spent on coffee. I would say 70% of the time the set up would be used for iced lattes, but we do enjoy hot latte/cappuccino every now and then (Perhaps even more so if I could make decent ones at home). 

Currently I am looking at the Profitech Go and a DF54 (or a Niche if I can land one used at a decent price). Originally was looking at a Gaggi, but was turned off by boilergate (I know they have a new version that apparently resolved it but eh) and prefer the look and extra features of the Go. I also would rather invest in a machine that will last a while (with regular up-keep, of course) rather than something more plastic-y in the 300-600 range. 

Also, I know many people argue that spending more on the grinder is important, but I can't seem to find anything cheaper than the Go that seems appealing. Also the fact that we love iced coffee drinks which probably slightly diminishes the importance of the grinder. 

  
Has anyone been in a similar spot and have any recommendations? Thanks :)

It's finally time to upgrade! Nowadays I make my coffee by filling up a reusable Nespresso cup with proper quality beans which I grinded with my comandante c40.

I usually drink lungo's made with light roasted beans (fruity), my wife however is more of a cappuccino/ latte macchiato drinker.

I went to a few stores within the neighbourhood (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and they all told me basically the same thing ""don't buy a machine you can buy at a non coffee store."" Refering to Delongi, sage, Solis. They all make good coffee, but not splendid coffee. 

And so I ended up with two brands in mind, quickmill (either the 820 or a second hand 3000/3035) and lelit (the Anna)

Is there a better choice between these machines? Or is there maybe a complete different better choice?

I've recently upgraded all of my equipment, over a short period of time. Profitec Drive, Timemore 064S, naked portafilter.

I've been having trouble dialing in my most recent batch of beans. If I set the grinder to anything higher than .5s, I get a very fast flow with spraying ‚Äì reaching a 1:2 ratio in <20s. If I go lower, the espresso gets kinda bitter (which seems weird since the beans look light roasted) and crema is lacking. I am fairly confident with my puck prep, I meticulously WDT and tamp uniformly... I have a VST 20g basket, if that helps.

Two questions:

- For owners of the same or equivalent grinder, what level do you usually set it to? Before I got this new batch of beans and the naked portafilter which highlighted issues, I would sometimes set it up to 2 and get a 1:2 ratio in over 30s, resulting in an espresso that tasted good to me. (But always hard to know if you're getting the *best* out of your beans.) Is this a range that sounds normal in terms of the coarseness level? Just how fine do you go?

- I've been playing with flow control, and I suspect that might be (part of) the issue ‚Äì opening it too much. I would start brewing with it open to only 1/4 of a turn, then when seeing the coffee start to appear under the basket ramp up to 1 1/4 turn (stock flow rate). I recently realized this was probably too much and started ramping up to only 1 turn. Wondering if this is still too much?

More generally, I'd also welcome any advice for using these machines after upgrading from a Breville Barista Pro :)

Cheers!"

She stood in the doorway, watching my machine heat up.
‚ÄúIs that a thermoblock in your pocket, or are you just running PID Auto-Tune?‚Äù
I tried to play it cool, but my pressure gauge was already edging past 9 bar.

‚∏ª

Chapter 2: The Grind Size of Desire
She brought her own beans‚Äîsingle origin, high altitude, emotionally unavailable.
I offered her my WDT tool and said, ‚ÄúYou might want to declump before we get into this.‚Äù
She smiled. ‚ÄúI like it messy. Just evenly messy.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Chapter 3: Tamp Me Harder
The counter shook. Grounds everywhere. She leaned in, watching me tamp.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a convex base,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúYou dirty, dirty thing.‚Äù
I locked in the portafilter like I meant it. She shivered.

‚∏ª

Chapter 4: Pressure Builds
The pump whirred to life. She bit her lip.
‚ÄúOh god‚Ä¶ ramp it slowly‚Ä¶ give me a 6-second pre-infusion or I‚Äôm gonna steam myself.‚Äù
The first drops hit the cup. Her pupils dilated.

‚∏ª

Chapter 5: Channeling
It wasn‚Äôt a perfect pull. There was some channeling.
She didn‚Äôt care.
‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about perfection,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs about crema and chaos.‚Äù
God, I loved her.

‚∏ª

Chapter 6: Spent Pucks and Regret
The shot was done. The silence hung like stale grounds.
She popped the portafilter, knocked out the puck, and wiped the grouphead in one motion.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do paper filters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOr second dates.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Chapter 7: Fully Degassed
She left without a word. The room smelled like coffee and emotional damage.
I stared at the blinking PID‚Äîstill set to 199.
I‚Äôd never pull a shot like that again.
But damn it‚Ä¶ she left her beans.

So I just got a new Dedica Arte and I dont know what am I doing wrong.

I started it and followed the steps on the ‚Äúquick guide‚Äù (which are basically just ejecting water through the milk steamer) so I turned the page and saw instructions for brewing and I gussed I must had been ready and started prepping some espresso and nothing came out, so I thought I was grinding too fine, adjusted and repeated many times until my grind size became ridicoulosly coarse, then I turned to the big user manual and realized the instructions for ‚Äúfirst use‚Äù are completely different to those in the quickguide. I turned off the machine, turned it on again and followed the steps for ‚Äúfirst use‚Äù in the long users manual. I tried pressing the two cup button after I was finished with the procedure and measuted the output (without any coffe or even the protafilter on) and the output was around 35 ml of water, which seems strange since the manual says the 2 cup button should go for around 90 ml.

After that I just used customized the amount of water to be ejected with the two cup button and then was able to pull a decent first shot.

While I achieved a good shot and It seems to know work I am still worried about the very little amount of water the machine was pre-set to deliver. I even tried the factory reset and still got around 35 ml of water with the 2 cup and 15 ml with the single cup.

I know I technically did something wrong since I didnt start the machine as intended in the first use (thanks to discrepancies en their documentation). But is this something I should worry about? Has someone had similar experiences?"

Alright folks, I know there is a TON of advice on here, which is so awesome but is also overwhelming. And I've spent every day since Wed. this week in the hospital with my mom (who we just found out has had several strokes), so I just need to ask for help.

I have had for probably 15 years a DeLonghi fully automatic espresso machine. It recently died. I knew my espresso wasn't as good running through that machine vs. a cafe, but I was willing to sacrifice that for convenience at the time.

I wanted to upgrade, but I'm new to the non-fully automatic game, so I kind of went in the middle and got a Breville Oracle Jet. The very first day I use it, the grinder throws an error saying it's overheating. Well, I pulled probably \~4 shots in a row as it was telling me to adjust the grind size to dial in my shots. So I turn the machine off and move on for the day (with my delicious espresso). Next day I come back. Machine has been off for 24 hours. Grinder still says it's overheating. I remove the hopper, I clear out the beans best I can. Still won't cooperate. So I'm done with that. It's going back. You can't talk me out of that one! I see folks talking about different kinds of beans, but I love this local roaster and it seems crazy that for $2k it can't handle whatever beans. 

It validated my worst fear about the machine - the grinder would fail (albeit I thought it would be many years later). So now I'd much prefer keeping them separate, but I am overwhelmed by the choices! I drink espresso with a little bit of cream and honey, but every once in a blue moon I'll make a latte. While I'm willing to put in the time to do this more manually and learn, I DO NOT want an espresso machine that takes more than a few minutes to heat up. I see your posts re smart plugs and commend you, but I want flexibility.

I generally do a single dose of 20g of light roast beans, for 50g output in 30sec and I add 160ml to 200ml whole milk to it.

My Encore ESP has broken down (for the second time this year!) and in repairs and I don't know how long those will take. My better half said she'd rather we just buy another grinder, and sell the Baratza when it is returned from the repairs.

I'm looking at the options, ideally something that is sold here locally, in Latvia (for local repairs), but it can also be something that is sold in the EU and ships here.

I think I want something nicer than the Baratza Encore ESP, perhaps \~64mm or larger flat burrs.

Unfortunately, some of the recommended options are not available locally in the EU so adding customs fees + VAT they become very expensive.

Some options that I've found are:

* Eureka Oro Mignon Single Dose PRO - EUR 640
* Eureka ORO Mignon Single Dose - EUR 500
* DF64 Gen 2 - EUR 490
* Timemore Sculptor Series White 064S - EUR 700
* Timemore Sculptor Series White 078S - EUR 800
* Niche Duo - \~EUR 750 (estimated)

4,2025-07-20,My experience with Aliexpress multipurpose knockoff burrs,u/itiswhatitisso,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m4j1hx/my_experience_with_aliexpress_multipurpose/,"As implied by the title, I have bought cheap multipurpose burrs from Aliexpress (30$). I installed them on the Fellow Ode gen 2 (if you dismiss my post because of this piece of information I have a note at the end of the post justifying it).

First off, they kind of look like the real deal. Here is an image of them: https://imgur.com/a/bNKQ2D8. However, they are not as sharp as the gen 2 stock burrs or the df54 stock out of the box. I can note that, wierdly, after seasoning them with 2 kgs of coffee they got sharper, which is the opposite of what you'd expect.

I used the marker test in order to improve alignment, even though the auger design of the Ode has its limitations concerning obtaining perfect alignment. The burrs churp two clicks before the marking on the outer portion of the burrs actually get wiped.

Regarding the user experience, for some reason (maybe increased friction due to imprecise machining) the retention is horrible. The chute gets clogged easily on both filter and espresso settings. Moreover, the burrs require slow feeding on both filter and espresso settings, otherwise the grinder stalls; keep in mind that I normally use light to ultra-light coffees for the MP burrs as god intended.

Ancedotally, I can report that both filter and espresso are clearer with more acidity (the filter compared to Ode stock burrs and the espresso compared to df54 burrs), so that's a plus. Still, I am not sure it is worth the hassle.

As a side note, you might be wondering how I can dial in espresso with the narrow range that the Ode provides; The first part of the answer is that I can choke my machine with these burrs on the finest settings; The second part is that I use the manual flair 58 which gives me the freedom to play with the dose, as I am not constrained by the ""correct"" capacity of the basket because the way the flair brews, the headspace is non existent (so I can underdose). Also I have a deep basket as well as a step-down basket, so there is that."

I‚Äôm looking to buy my first espresso machine, and I‚Äôm hoping to get some guidance from the experts here before I dive in. I'm based in the UK so looking to source it from here.

I‚Äôve fallen in love with the¬†**Nurri L-TYPE S.A. Lever**¬†; the design, the lever mechanism, the build quality, everything about it just speaks to me and importantly, my mrs! I understand this is a very high-end machine (both in cost and capability), and I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs a spring-lever machine, which comes with its own set of quirks and rituals.

Here‚Äôs my situation:

* I‚Äôm a total beginner when it comes to home espresso. I‚Äôve made plenty of pour-over and AeroPress over the years, but I‚Äôve never owned an espresso machine before.
* I‚Äôm looking for a long-term investment that I won‚Äôt outgrow quickly.
* I enjoy the ritual and hands-on process of coffee brewing. I‚Äôm not after one-touch convenience, but I also don‚Äôt want to get overwhelmed and frustrated from the start.
* Budget is flexible, but I do want to be thoughtful and realistic about what‚Äôs appropriate for a beginner.

Preferred drinks and frequency - Likely 2-4 cappuccinos a day (for 2 people) and then an espresso or 2.  

So my key questions are:

1. Is the Nurri L-TYPE S.A.¬†*too much machine*¬†for a first-timer? Would I be better served by starting with something a bit more forgiving or mainstream?
2. What should I know about lever machines (especially spring levers) as a beginner? Are they as temperamental or niche as some make them out to be?
3. What are some hidden challenges or maintenance quirks I should be aware of with a machine like this? Not hugely experience with tinkering so also
4. Are there¬†other lever machines¬†or alternatives I should consider in this tier or slightly below? I've seen the Vostok, Profitec 800, Londinium etc.
5. Will I miss out on key learning experiences or conveniences by not starting with something like a Profitec Pro Go/ move or a lelit bianca v3 etc. 
6. What Grinder should I pair this with? Looking at a Weber Key, Mazzer Philos, maybe Zerno Z2. Any others?

Any insights, anecdotes, or things you wish you'd known when starting out would be massively appreciated. I‚Äôd especially love to hear from any other lever machine owners who started from scratch like I am.

Thanks in advance for your advice!"

I'll write a list below of requirements to make it easy: 
- Any espresso machine letting me use ground beans (obviously), with high concentration and minimum water. 
- Not too expensive. I don't mind if all it does is make espressos as explained above, I don't need customization beyond that or a steamer, I usually make shots for iced lattes.

40,2025-07-20,Bambino Plus return review,u/TuesdaysBrunch,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m4y0k9/bambino_plus_return_review/,"I started my espresso journey with a bambino plus and a crappy grinder, I eventually upgraded to a Niche Zero which I used with the bambino for about a year or 2. Last December I made the $1600 jump to the Lelit Mara X. I just went on vacation with my family and I didn‚Äôt want bring the Mara so I dusted off the bambino and used it for the week.

I thought this was a unique opportunity to go back to what I started with and give my honest take on how it compares to more expensive machines like my Mara X and if the price jump is really worth it. Although I try to learn and experiment with espresso, I am in no way an expert, I don‚Äôt overly tinker with things, and I don‚Äôt pretend to taste every note of fig or hazelnut in my espresso.

As far as straight espresso brewing/extraction, I honestly believe the Mara X gives me a better tasting espresso. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a huge difference but it was noticeable both straight and in my cappuccino which I pretty much exclusively drink. I just felt the Mara X gave me stronger flavor/extraction, the coffee flavor punches through my drink more and I thought it tasted a little fuller bodied and less acidic.

As far as the steam wand goes, I was getting a lot of practice with the Mara so I tried manually steaming with the bambino for the first time and I was really impressed actually. In some ways I actually preferred it, I thought it was a little more forgiving because it doesn‚Äôt have as much power as the Mara. So if you screwed up a bit and injected a little too much air at some point or something it didn‚Äôt seem to have as much as an impact. I was able to make a pretty nice velvety microfoam in under a minute. I will say that if I don‚Äôt make any mistakes on the Mara, I think I get a slightly smoother, more homogenous microfoam which is a bit more luscious. 

Build quality, big win to Lelit, the breville feels cheap and a bit clunky but it‚Äôs also instant and doesn‚Äôt need a 15-20minute heat up time. Optics, the Mara is just cool looking if you‚Äôre into that style. 

Overall, I was pretty impressed with my little $400 machine that‚Äôs gotten a lot of use. I think if you just want to get into espresso and make a decent drink then this will suit you well, I think the grinder is more important like most people say. If I had to put some sort of rating on it I would say my Mara x gives me like a 8.75/10 espresso shot in terms of quality and taste and the bambino gave me a 7/10. So not far behind. I wouldn‚Äôt make the jump to a more expensive machine unless you enjoy the actual process of making espresso and you truly have the budget for one. If you drink straight espresso I think you will taste the difference and be happy with your upgrade, if you primarily drink milk drinks, you may taste the difference but it won‚Äôt be a huge jump. Your coffee flavor may just punch through the drink more and perhaps give you a fuller bodied drink. 

I‚Äôm sure other people feel differently but wanted to give my opinion. Maybe this will help somebody make a choice!

Hi all.  I have been rocking the BBE since COVID.  Almost exclusively drink flat whites, lattes and the odd straight espresso. Wanting to explore a bit more,  but ultimately I am a creature of convenience.  Rather than upgrade the BBE (which is fine in my books, but getting the itch...if you know what I mean), I see the smart advice is to get a good grinder first so looking for recommendations and advice 

I have been weighing beans, is there something that can do and grind stuff  as an all in one feature already (eg not have to use scale)?

Ideally less than $750 (cheaper is better, but I can go up if the consensus is there + hits reccs) 

should be something that I can keep for if/when I get a new espresso machine. Maybe profitec in future?

Hi guys I would really appreciate your opinions. I'm upgrading from a nespresso to an espresso machine. I never drink hot drinks so I don't care about milk frothing or steam; I mainly just want a taste upgrade from the nespresso pods so I am not asking a lot from my machine.

I am choosing between the Gaggia classic pro and Breville Bambino. I saw this on sale so I wonder whether this would be a good deal. I also heard that Gaggia had some issues with some previous machine so I wonder whether this specific 2019 model would be problematic or not. Any other comments and suggestions will also be appreciated.

I am based in Los Angeles."

Had a breville Bambino (not a plus) with a baratza virtuoso grinder (with plastic spacer removed/modified for espresso). This set up served it's purpose for years, but died a while ago.

I have since added the spacer in the baratza and have switched to pourover and cold brew, while I do research for a new upgraded toy.

I do understand I will need a better grinder to match, but that will be a 2025 Christmas gift from the family! I will ask about that in a separate post.

Relevant information about:

Price range for machine $1k-2k (could do higher, but would prefer to save for the December grinder purchase)

80%+ of the drinks will be milk based and I always make two (Double shot cappuccino or latte). 

Once a month we have guests, so I need to make 3-6 drinks 12-18 times a year.

Quick heat up time is important. My schedule is in constant flux. Friend had a Mara X (it makes amazing drinks) but the 20-25 minute heat up time of an E61 is a deal breaker.

Would like a PID & screen (i like to experiment).

Would like a strong steam wand. Since most drinks will be milk based. Was thinking a dual boiler (or boiler & thermablock combo) would be nice for when we have guests, but not mandatory.

I've seen the Lelit Elizabeth dual boiler recommended on here and other sites @$1.8k

The friend with the Mara X recommended an ascaso steel duo @$2.1k or a Dilemma Mio @$1.4k.

While with the above mentioned info, chat GPT recommended a Profitec MOVE dual boiler @$2.1k.

I would appreciate any guidance or first hand experience with the above mentioned machines, or any recommendations on a brand I might have missed and should look into."

May I introduce, the Delonghi Twins:

* The ""Dedica"" EC685M Espresso Machine
* The KG520 Grinder

For the unaware, this is a pinnacle of what your *regular white-appliance* shop had to offer for the enthusiast (at least in France, circa 2018). I did not know better at that time and it was either one of the 74 variations of Nespresso machines, or the expensive and ""meh"" all-in-one machine that grind and brew at the push of a button.

The Delonghis look similar, nice, kind of retro-vintage... the wife acceptance score is very high. But oh my god, the headaches.

The thing is, grinders are IM-POR-TANT. And the KG520 has no business pretending to be an espresso grinder.  And no, it's not even a conical vs. flat burrs, discussion. It is just flawed, and a lie. Even though, on the dial, it says ""Espresso"". It is nowhere near capable enough. Some seller put it this way ""for espresso **with pressurized filter**"". I see what you did here.

The words are important. Try anything else than a pressurized filter and you are in for some pain.

Pressurized filters are amazing at hiding flaws. The result is a somewhat bland coffee that would satisfied most (I was). 

But. I wanted more... The lie started to fall appart when I ventured to bottomless portafilters and sprayed my shoes, kitchen and pride no matter what. I've tried all the things (apart using a different grinder). And to this day I refuse naked portafilters, the pain is still there. I even tried to mod it by placing small washers below the the burr to... no significant result at all.

I could not resolve myself back to the pressurized filters and settled on a regular basket with spouted portafilter (to hide the mess). And yes, FAST AND SOUR. It was not bland for sure. But it was sour.

Years of sourness. I've grown so used to it that I found any other coffee that did not taste like battery acid ""Nice"". Maybe I should have gone back to the pressurised portafilter and used it has the engineers at Delonghi would have wanted me to. But THE SOURNESS. Everyting tasted the same. And I was OK with that. It was *my* coffee.

Fast forward a few weeks ago. I got my hand onto:

* A used Eureka Mignon Classico (about ‚Ç¨200)
* A used Gaggia Classic (pre 2015) (same price)

Which is the current retail price for each of the Delonghis albeit ""new"". And yes both machine were gross and disgusting when I received them.
For the Deglonghi, I paid ‚Ç¨200 for both at the time of purchase as open box deals.

The Dedica machine has its issues but it's very capable. I may have kept it around a bit longer. Plus, I can see the discussion between 51 and 58mm, etc. Now, the real game changer was moving to an actually capable grinder.

OH MY GOD.

Coffee now tastes the same as in the caf√©/restaurant/anywhere else! Even better sometimes. Different brand have different taste?! no way?! You can drink a ristretto without your soul suddenly shrinking from the shock of the sourness?!

So, here it is. Grinder. GRINDER GRINDER GRINDER. Buy used, it's OK.

Here is my advice. Don't buy it for espresso. Don't gift it to your loved ones. Believe people on the internet."

Before that, I had a super-automatic machine, which started the coffee obsession, so I have come a long way! Did a post the other day and have spent the past few days deep diving and I am hitting information overload....

  
I did an online quiz and the Profitec Drive came up as the best result for what I am making on a daily basis (I feel like they just want to recommend an expensive machine if you have the budget!). I have a friend who has the Rocket Apartamento so I have an idea of how to use a more advanced machine than the Breville Barista Pro. I do not make a ton of milk based drinks on my own, but something I make often for guests, the double boiler is an extra upgrade that sounds great but not sure if it is worth the cost? What other features does this machine have, say over the LELIT Bianca or the Rocket Apartamento (still not sure what upgraded features on the TCA vs normal). 

Another machine I have considered is a LM-either Mini or Micro. I know the Mini is above the stated budget, but I do have expensive taste... Buy once, cry once as my mother always says! But, not sure if this machine just has a gold standard around it for the name or is actually something to look into and invest in now while I am already going to spend a good chunk of change. 

I live in a rental so am unable to plumb a machine in, so taking that into consideration. I also do not plan to mess with the flow control settings right away, which I know is a selling point of the more expensive machines. I am going to deep dive into grinders, but right now my single dose grinder is doing the job. I will probably pull the trigger on a grinder before a machine upgrade, but taking extra time on the machine to get my head wrapped around a new machine first as that is a lot more research!"

I have a Eureka Mignon Manuale with the stock 50mm burrs, and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here has ever tried swapping them out for the 55mm burrs from the Specialit√† model.

From what I can tell, the motor in both grinders seems to be the same (the sticker on mine say 310V), so I‚Äôm curious if the upgrade is mechanically possible and whether it‚Äôs worth doing in terms of grind quality and performance.

Has anyone attempted this mod? Did it fit without modifications? Any noticeable improvements?

I try to get 32 grams out at 30 seconds. 16 grams at 1.3 grind setting is now done at 26 seconds. The first few months with the grinder the lowest setting think I ever used was 1.8 or 1.7.

Was wondering what this valve exactly does and if it being blocked by scale build up can cause the steam pressure to rise beyond fun values at initial start up (something the machine does until I open the steam valve for a bit.. and very old machines too). This valve is where in non PID machines the pressostat gets screwed in. But the machine is modern enough to have some sort of anti vacuum valve, I assume. Which it doesn't have in the steam boiler. But I figured this might just be that. It has a copper pipe from steam boiler to the valve. One tiny pipe to the pressure gauge, and two exits with silicone hoses that go to the drainage system.

There is a exit side with a big spring and one with the tiniest spring on planet earth. So I imagine the tiny side would be for the trapped air to escape when the machine heats up (to make place for steam) and the big spring is the ""if things go too spicy"" valve. Which would mean a clean and functioning valve would eliminate the need for an extra anti vacuum valve, right? (Which is not available for this boiler anyway because it uses a dumb g 1/8"" filling port instead of the g 1/4"". "

I was shimming my burrs and in the process of putting the top burr on and off I have stripped the threads inside of the hole. I am sure there is a proper lingo for that but that's the best way I can explain, maybe photos will help.

The screw can be kinda tighten as there is a part of the thread that is still there. However instead of righty-tighty it goes right-tighy then loosy and tighty again. 

It's on the top burr carrier so it's a static burr and it SHOULD be fine, however I don't prefer metal flakes flavored espresso and further, the scene where the screw falls off during grinding and absolutely destroys my grinder, part of my arm, ceiling and neighbours cat often crosses my mind. 

What should I do?

1. Try to rethread the hole and change to the wider screw and potentially mess it up even more?

2. Get that locktite super glue for metal and fix it with it?

3. Get that two-component glue resistant to meteor strikes and glue that screw in until the eons eat it away?

4. Somehow, somewhere try to find and replace the whole top burr carrier?

5. Something that one of you good people can suggest?

I've increased the grind size to finer and finer more, and still no dice. I think I'm up to 11 grind, where the manufacturer recommends anywhere from 8-10.  I also put almost all my bbodyweight into tamping, which sometimes helps and most times, doesn't. I don't see anyone else having to tamp that aggressively.

After two years with the Sage Barista Pro (which broke just within warranty and we got a refund), we‚Äôre looking to upgrade. We really enjoyed getting into espresso and are ready for something more serious.

What we‚Äôre looking for:
- Ease of use & good durability
- PID
- Pre-infusion
- Stainless steel look
- Quick to heat up
- E61
- No integrated grinder
- My girlfriend wants a dual boiler (she drinks milk drinks), I don‚Äôt. Any advice?

Our budget is max ‚Ç¨2000. We‚Äôre currently considering the Expobar Brewtus, Crem One 2B or 3, or anything else you guys would recommend. We‚Äôve considered the Lelit Bianca but don‚Äôt like the wooden parts in the design.

Would love your suggestions. Thanks!

7,2025-07-21,More portable espresso tests,u/derping1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m5uoxe/more_portable_espresso_tests/,"I received my portable espresso machine a couple of days ago by now (hibrew h4c barista ultra edition) a couple of days ago.

My initial tests were done with a medium espresso roasts and were overall very positive. I have just finished testing some more beans to get a good overview.

For the testing I used my kettle to warm up water to 85C to speed up the testing and preserve some battery life. I fixed input at 16 grams and set the brew time to 30 seconds.
To keep with the portable setup I dialed in all my espresso using a 1Zpresso X-pro S (old bur geometry)

I tested a traditional medium 75% arabica 25% robusta blend. I found a sweet spot at 90C with a grind setting of 0.4.7 which produced 35 grams in 30 seconds. Overall a rich and smooth espresso. It holds up well on its own, but really shines when paired with a little bit of milk.

Second I tested the more challenging light espresso roast. 100% arabica, arara varietal, natural process. Other reports of similar machines like the outin nano report difficulties with lighter roasts. This should really test what the H4C is capable off. Initial tests were done at 95C with a grind setting of 0.3.7 and produced 17 grams out in 30 seconds. As expected this was vinegar. Still I was happy to see the machine didn‚Äôt simply choke up. I relaxed the grind settings to 0.4.3 and pulled another shot which resulted in 28 grams out. I got a well rounded espresso and could clearly pick out the choc-orange flavour notes. Could I have gone a tick coarser? Probably. Nonetheless it was 10PM and instead of slurping and spitting I ended up drinking the entire shot. It was delicious.

The overall workflow is also pretty good. Filling the basket and funnel with 16 grams looks like it is not going to fit, but after a quick WDT with the included tool and a tamp, everything fits nicely. The biggest downside in the entire workflow is that the basket  keep dripping after the pump shuts down. There is no 3 way solenoid, so this should be expected.

Since the barista ultra comes with a 51 mm bottomless portafilter, we can actually get some money shots of the extraction. In all instances I did find some hints of channeling. I suspect that this can probably be solved using a matching 51 mm puck screen.

In conclusion, I think this is a brilliant piece of kit that solves the major issue people had with portable espresso makers. 

If you you want me to test anything else or do some comparisons, let me know and I‚Äôll see what I can do."

Changing beans, precise 18g doses, WDT, tamping tools, adjusting burr settings, testing water, flushing, you name it.

I just got off a call with Breville support where I walked the rep through my entire shot process. I specifically said I use the double basket and do an 18g dose with the machine set to double. We ran it and I got 74g out in 30s. She immediately told me a double shot should be 74g out not 36. Huh?

Everything I‚Äôve read here and elsewhere says ~36g out for a standard double (1:2 ratio). Is Breville operating on some totally different logic? Are there one too many doubles going on here? Am I that $@!?-&# stupid? Are they confusing something? Am I? I‚Äôve literally never seen 1:4 recommended for a traditional double, especially not using a standard double basket.

I've gathered that the M2 burr is necessary to grind fine enough for espresso on the Encore, and it's a cheap upgrade. That being said, I've also heard the dial adjustment on the Encore is still inadequate for espresso even with the better burr. So that seems to leave me with three options:

* Option A: Buy a new grinder, eg. the DF54 or DF64, and get a budget espresso machine like the Breville Bambino Plus.

* Option B: Buy the M2 burr upgrade and continue using my Encore, then spend the whole budget on a nicer espresso machine. The problem is, I'm having trouble even identifying what the next step up is from the Bambino Plus in that ~$1000 CAD price range.

* Option C: Buy a lifetime's supply of V60 papers.

Some other things I should note:

* I generally drink light and medium roasted coffees from local roasters in Vancouver, Canada (where I am located).

* Electric grinder that can conveniently handle single doses is a must.

* The majority of the cups will be for myself, but occasionally I'll be pulling 2-3 shots subsequently to attempt to impress a friend or date.

* I'm brand new to espresso and have no idea what I like or what I'm doing."

I went with the Baratza ESP for my grinder, got a scale, WDT, Normcore Spring Loaded Tamper (the plastic one it comes with is brutal), and a magnetic dosing funnel.

My next purchase will be a new portafilter with a bit more weight to it, but I‚Äôm in no rush. Any tips, tricks, feedback, or opinions about the setup are welcome :)"

Preferred Drink: Straight Espresso and the occasional latte 

Drink Frequency: Min of 1 per day, some days 2-3. 

Space: Max size is my current Breville Barista Express. Preferably looking for something minimal yet powerful. 

Exp level: On a scale of 1-10: I would be a 4. I had my workflow pretty well set up with my current tools. Auto-grinder broke, and I would prefer not to use my manual one as I need to hustle in the mornings! 

Manual or electric: I recently ordered a DF64 grinder. I am looking for a machine that can automate my workflow (or at least some parts of it) but still let me tweak whenever I need to. Essentially, I want my workflow to be sped up and to be consistent and flexible to my needs.

Candidates: 1. [This](https://www.merakitech.com/products/meraki-espresso-machine) one hits all the right notes for me but it's way over budget. 2. On the other hand, [this](https://fellowproducts.com/products/espresso-series-1) one hits my budget and has the look and feel I prefer (size; minimalist style). The problem with my choices is that the first one is out of budget, and both seem like newer machines (haven't seen a review from Hoffman, et al), and the companies are new (I could be mistaken). 

Lastly, as I said I'll have a good grinder so the machine doesn't need to have a grinder included. "

Shouldn't the difference between small conicals and larger flat burrs be night and day? Does it take palate training, to be able to tell tiny minute differences, that non-trained people can't pick up on? Or, are the differences only perceivable on light roast specialty coffee?

I am using 18 grams of 80/20 arabica to robusta espresso beans, roasted freshly by a local roaster. They are med/dark, and I can pick up chocolate notes. But, I really don't notice a difference in taste between the small conical grinder and the flat burr.

Ironically I returned the first one after a week as the factory grinder was so far off what espresso grind should be, it was ridiculous.

This machine didn‚Äôt have that issue. A 26 sec by the third trial. Bang on.

The problem this machine is having though, is water seems to be boiling in the head and coming out as steam. It didn‚Äôt do this for the first 3 shots when new, and neither did the last one of these I had. I‚Äôve purged the steam, purged the water, turned it off, back on again. All comes out the same. The flow rate after pre-infusion is also much more ‚Äòchanelly‚Äô than it was before the boiling issue.

If I drop the temperature to the lowest, it doesn‚Äôt do it anymore, but also the flow rate seems even worse. Not a clean or even drop-drop. It also shouldn‚Äôt need to be dropped to the lowest setting to not boil.

It seems to me that someone has malfunctioned after a few shots. I also have a dual boiler machine at home and that certainly doesn‚Äôt do it either. Usually a purge after switching from steam to espresso sorts this. But this machine seems to be stuck doing that now. I‚Äôve also tried the default setting reset and still the same.

The head and water rate just doesn‚Äôt run anything like it did in those first few shots when it was first out of the box. Adequate water and all the rest."

1,2025-07-22,A Student‚Äôs Tale,u/Zealousideal_Let9726,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m6hsbn/a_students_tale/,"Two months ago after unboxing our new Breville, my son (a passionate young fellow who, at 11, isn‚Äôt allowed to drink a whole coffee yet but can‚Äôt get enough of the process and experience) and I struggled mightily for several hours pulling shot after shot of catastrophic failure.  We had decided to try a single shot first, using the built in grinder single shot button and the automatic single shot extraction button.  It was a disaster both by metric of no pressure generating on the gauge and by literal results in the cup.  Gross.  Terrible.  Fail.  After multiple hours of desperate reading and internet scouring, we finally discovered our unit had come with a double filter basket installed.  Ironically both my son and I consider ourselves at least mildly intelligent.  It was both humbling and inspiring to start our journey this way.  We‚Äôd developed respect for the art nearly in an instant‚Ä¶

Over time we‚Äôve gotten smarter, and more skilled, and more versed in how different flavors come out of different beans.  Truly glorious flavors indeed.  And I‚Äôm recounting this tale because I read of others struggling at first, or with new equipment, and the generous and benevolent folks on this sub fall over themselves to help and reassure that, in time, you‚Äôll figure this out.  Then, it becomes about discovery and enjoyment.

My 2 month advice is as follows.  Beauty and flavor come from consistency.  Use a scale and timer for your pulls.  Measure your doses.  Tamp and distribute the same way.  If you have a Breville machine, run everything in manual mode.  Get control of the pieces.  A distribution and tamper are worthy investments.  However, the biggest boost to our success here is probably the least expensive accessory you can acquire and from what I understand is a relatively new invention.  Yup, the puck screen.  Ours is a .8 but you choose the thickness and make sure it has headspace.  It has improved our consistency almost exponentially.  I‚Äôd swear by it.

Anyway, hope this helps someone.  Pull on, my friends."

When I was about to drink my coffee I saw this wrinkly almost plastic looking thing floating on top. Now it‚Äôs all wrinkled up but it was like a thin film. Does anyone know what this is??

Another thing that I‚Äôve never seen was the espresso delayed for like ~10 whole seconds maybe and then came out like a WALL. I didn‚Äôt think much of it but maybe there was plastic in there? Idk

I‚Äôm just very sad that I probably shouldn‚Äôt drink this and now I have no coffee :(

I am in a sticky situation and could use the insight of some experts. I work at a business (not a cafe or anything to do with food), but a very large and strict health-care business. We have offices, naturally, and people want coffee. But, the only machines we can buy MUST have ""C-UL"" rating, which stands for ""commercial"" UL rating, see below

It also needs to have a three-prong (grounded) electrical cord. This is the only way we will be allowed coffee. The way it stands, we have no coffee, and never have. I'd like to see if I can change that. But it's hard to search for this rating, because google suggests commercial machines - as in, commercial for a cafe - which is not what we can do haha. Just one head is fine, two if we have to. Is this possible?????"

I modded my Ascaso grinder, added inner noise vibration and sound dampening, modified grinding chamber exit and chute to lower retention, coming from 2-3g stuck to zero-ish 90% ot the time. Some other times it's .1 or less. 

Got all the needed tools, nothing fancy (I joke showing my tamper being a PUSEE), even puck screens from Temu.

To satisfy both my own curiosity and the request of other folks I‚Äôve done some head to head comparisons. I used a light espresso roasted natural arabica (arara) with hints of chocolate and orange.

I compared my profitec go and niche zero with the H4C and 1Zpresso x-pro. Both the profitec go and the H4C had their PID set to 95. I dosed 16 grams for the H4C and 18 grams for the Go. Both were dialed in to produce a 1:2 shot in 30 seconds. Both shots tasted overall well extracted, but while the shots on the Go tasted more rounded and had chocolate on the forefront with orange lingering, the H4C produced a much more fruit forward shot with chocolate moving to the background. And dare I say I preferred this shot.

Clearly, as a portable setup the combination of the 1Zpresso x-pro and H4C produce a delicious shot of espresso. However I am now left to explain the difference between the two shots, is it possibly all down to the grinder?

For future comparisons I will see how the different grinders affect the in cup result."

I‚Äôve had my new Bezzera Unica PID for about a week now ‚Äî absolutely love it so far! That said, I‚Äôve noticed a couple of strange noises and wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced the same.

Specifically:

* When I insert the portafilter for backflushing, or when the grind is too fine, I hear a noticeable noise.
* I tried removing the cups from the cup warmer and the water tank cover to rule out vibrations, but the sound persists. Do you think is just some metal sheet noise or something more serious?
* In the second video, at the end of the heating cycle, there's a long, high-pitched whistle ‚Äî not sure if it‚Äôs related to pressure or a valve releasing steam.

Anyone with the same machine or similar experience ‚Äî is this normal, or should I be concerned?

I currently own a Delonghi Dinamica Plus, coming from Nespresso.. But I'm still unhappy with espresso quality. Find it to wattery, and unbalanaced, wether too sour or bitter. Can't find the sweet spot.

I'm also disappointed with Latte Crema. Milk is not creamy (despite whole milk) but like foamy.

I know an external grinder with good coffe machine is the graal but I can't for many reasons :  
\- Not enough place  
\- Not enough time to practice  
\- Family members still want quite an easy to use machine

Therefore I'm looking forward Breville Oracle Jet. But a question remains : Will I really get better coffee/espressos ??

Has anyone such a move ? I'm interested.

Thanks for any advice.

I currently have a Comandante with red clix, and a bambino. I drink both espresso (usually a Cortado or Americano, rarely straight) and pour over daily. I really enjoy the Comandante for pour over, but I‚Äôm getting tired of grinding at the espresso setting and switching between settings.

I‚Äôm looking to add an electric grinder to complement the Comandante, but I‚Äôm stuck between a few options. Looking at $1000 CAD maximum, preferably less. 

Encore ESP - price is great, and I usually make Cortado‚Äôs with medium roasted beans so I‚Äôm not sure that I really need anything better than this.

Lagom Casa - much more expensive, and I‚Äôm concerned that it will have a similar profile to the c40. Looks great, well made, and well reviewed.

Sculptor 64S - about the same price as the casa. Flat burrs will hopefully(?) add a different taste profile compared to the c40. I can always change burrs in the future.

I‚Äôm running into a puzzling (but very repeatable) issue and could use some help troubleshooting.
	‚Ä¢	Equipment: Breville Barista Pro + 1Zpresso J-Ultra manual grinder
	‚Ä¢	Dose / Basket: 18 g in a 54 mm double basket
	‚Ä¢	Target yield & time: 36 g out in ~30 s
	‚Ä¢	Beans: Medium roast, 14 days off roast
	‚Ä¢	Prep: WDT ‚Üí level ‚Üí tamp, no channeling visible
	‚Ä¢	Machine preheat: Blank shot before the first pull

What happens, every time:
	1.	Grind two identical doses back-to-back at the same setting.
	2.	Pull shot #1 with dose A ‚Üí ~30 s.
	3.	Pull shot #2 with dose B ‚Üí ~22‚Äì24 s (6‚Äì8 s faster).

To rule out the machine, I reversed the order (pulled dose B first). The coffee that was ground second always gives the faster shot‚Äîso the speed difference follows the grind, not the machine. I can reproduce this all day: the second-ground coffee consistently runs 6‚Äì8 s faster.

Hypothesis: heat from the first grind might expand the burrs or housing just enough to make the second dose slightly coarser; I do notice the handle turns a bit easier on that second batch.

Has anyone else seen this? Any suggestions for isolating the cause‚Äîor confirming whether heat expansion really could shift particle size this much?

Thanks in advance!"

First impressions were great, built like a tank, beautiful to look at but in my case, very very inconsistent. Huge variances between shots, the smallest changes having huge impacts. I worked with the local distributor here in Australia (CWE) and we troubleshooted but unfortunately after 3 months we couldn't land on a solution and they offered me a full refund, huge kudos to them for offering that .

So, I took a bit of a punt (mainly because there isn't a lot of info out there) and have gone with the WPM ZP-1. This is currently Toms Grinder Lab's favourite grinder (at the time of this post) and his review definitely swayed me (just as it did with the Philos :)). It's definitely not as pretty, or built like the Philos but it's grinding perfectly and consistently. Definitely worth considering if you're in the market at that price point."

Now I‚Äôm moving soon and the new place doesn‚Äôt have an elevator, I‚Äôll hate carrying cases of water upstairs.

However, I am having a bit of difficulty in finding my optimum settings. 
The argos came with a stock 15gram basket which I ditched for my 16-18gram IMS basket as I‚Äôve read that the 58mm basket would work better with larger dose of beans. 

My set-up:
- Argos with 8 bar spring
- Eureka mignon manuale
- I use WDT to get rid of clumps
- Local roaster medium roast beans, roasted about 3 weeks ago
- Temperature at 92 celsius
- I am aiming for a 1:2 shot ratio

Looking at my shot, there‚Äôs plenty of blind spots. Especially towards the end I feel it‚Äôs just water coming out of the portafilter, instead of proper dark coffee. I have blind spots as well with a 15g dose (in my stock 15g basket). I am unsure what to do now to improve.

Should I updose even further?
Grind finer?
Use the 6 bar spring?
Anything else?

[$2500],u/WeddingWhole4771,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m775jj/what_are_you_paying_for_with_a_more_expensive/,"So I've been in love with coffee since I was a kid, I blame my mom who'd let me steal a sip from hers as a 5 yo, and I remember being in 6th grade, making a pot of coffee before school.  So my Son-in-Law is staying with me, and he's got a Breville, Impressa I think.  I've gotten hooked on making a few drinks a day, pretty much all Lattes and Iced Americano's.  

Anyways, I'm a bit overwhelmed looking at machines.  I was looking at The Gaggia Classic Pro and the Rancilio Silvia.  Also a double boiler seems nice, but maybe it's not a need.  I also read because of the larger boilers on some of these, they need to warm up, so it should have a timer and stay on all day?  I had a cheap machine at some point, but it broke and I absolutely want something I can fix if it breaks, but don't want to be tinkering with it more than every few years (descaling and normal maintenance seems fine).

Anyways, I could see myself going deep in here, but I can't help but feel spending 3x is just a waste.  I did get a nice single shot manual grinder which I use for the decaf in the afternoon when a 3rd - 5th cup would be super unwise.

Anyways, should I just go with a Bambino?  Seems like the simple Barista Express is about the same amount here.  Will I actually notice a difference?  
  
I will say on the grinding side, a solid GBW grinder, or something with a good timer, seems best for my personality.  I did the pour over thing because my BIL does, but after a week I went to a nice auto machine, with an insulated carafe, with daily grinding.  So I'm not going pre-weigh a single shot multiple times a day, that's half the reason my sourdough starter is inactive ATM.  I don't mind dialing in a machine over a few mornings for my beans, but most days I just want to make a good drink and be done, then jump back when I can (I work from home thankfully).  My SILs has already probably saved me a few hundred between me and my wife over the past month already.

I also need to get a full tamping setup if people want to share ideas.  I was close to getting one last week for the single shot grinder.  Also, how do you not make a mess pouring from the cup to the group?

Sorry it's so long, I've been going a bit crazy the last 2 weeks.  Wasted about an hour or two last night and backed out again."

recently the gasket inside my Delonghi Stilosa EC235.BK has been damaged. There are 2 pieces of rubber that keep the portafilter stable and prevent leaking on the 2 sides.

On top of the image you can see the side which is still good, on the bottom the damaged side:

As you can see on the bottom image the rubber is too much on the left side and doesn't stay in place anymore.

I searched for ""Delonghi Stilosa gasket"" but I only find the ""ring"" shaped one that is located in the center, I don't even know if ""gasket"" is the correct term for this part.

Anyone knows if it is possible to buy this part somewhere?"

Hoping to get some advice from folks who are more experienced.

**Current Setup (since March 2022):**

* Gaggia Classic Pro
* Breville Smart Grinder Pro

**Coffee Preferences (kinda?):**

* We haven‚Äôt experimented much because dialing in is such a pain with our current setup.
* Our go-to is Caf√© Britt‚Äôs Montecielo. Haven‚Äôt really deviated.
* I¬†*think*¬†I like body but also appreciate clarity.
* My wife¬†*thinks*¬†she prefers clarity.
* Since we mostly drink milk drinks, we‚Äôre not even sure how much it matters.

**Daily Use:**

* 98% of the time we make iced lattes (me: unsweetened almond milk, her: unsweetened oat milk)
* 2% of the time: hot lattes or cappuccinos in colder weather

**The Problem:**

* Some days our drinks are great. Other days they‚Äôre awful. Same beans, same workflow- wild inconsistency. I‚Äôm over it.
* Time to upgrade the grinder (and storage system, but that's covered)

**What We Want:**

* Easy to dial in
* Consistent results
* Single-dose
* Would be¬†*nice*¬†to shift over to French press, AeroPress, Moka, pour-over, etc, but not a priority

**Budget:**

* \~$1,000 or less is ideal, but room to stretch if there's obvious value

**Grinders We‚Äôve Considered:**

* **Niche Zero**¬†‚Äì Feels a little dated and pricey now, but still probably my top choice
* **Philos**¬†‚Äì I think my 2nd choice?
* **X64SD**¬†‚Äì Intriguing, but not enough real-world info yet
* **DF64**¬†‚Äì For whatever reason, I just don‚Äôt love it

23,2025-07-23,My Experience with Seasoning my Grinder (Timemore 078s ‚Äì ~3kg in),u/BeanCounsel,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m7bk66/my_experience_with_seasoning_my_grinder_timemore/,"I was initially hesitant to season my 078s. It arrived just two days ago. My wife and I usually split a double shot daily ‚Äî sometimes two ‚Äî so we‚Äôre not heavy users.

I had read quite a bit on the general benefits of burr seasoning, and more specifically about the 078s (including feedback from several YouTubers). I honestly didn‚Äôt think it was necessary and figured I‚Äôd just let the grinder season naturally over time. But eventually, curiosity got me.

I found 2 forgotten 2.5 lb bags of Starbucks Winter Blend at my parents‚Äô house. They were labeled medium roast, but looked closer to dark (typical for Starbucks). Fortunately, they were quite stale and dry ‚Äî very little oil. That gave me about 2.3 kg of beans to begin with. Based on what I‚Äôd read, the consensus was anywhere from 2 kg to 7 kg for seasoning. The upper end seemed absurd to me, but I figured I could at least hit the low end.

Before I started, I pulled a baseline shot using Equator Coffees' Jaguar Espresso (a dark roast I like). It was good, but noticeably acid-forward.

For seasoning, I set the RPM to max (to speed up the process) and the grind dial to around 4.5‚Äì5. I ran both bags straight through the grinder without substantive breaks (usually a minute or two to dump the bowl filled with grinds). The whole process took maybe an hour. I didn‚Äôt bother stopping to cool the grinder. It seemed to be running fine the entire time.

Small note: the 078s did shut itself off occasionally, but I believe it was a time-based auto-shutoff rather than a thermal one. I could pretty reliably predict when it would happen, and simply turning it back on resumed grinding without issue.

After that, I ran another three 12 oz (~340 g) bags of random old coffee I had stored in the freezer ‚Äî gifted beans I never wanted to brew.

The process itself was incredibly messy. Seasoning with a single-dose hopper was tedious. Popcorning made it worse. But to the grinder‚Äôs credit, it wasn‚Äôt designed to churn through 3+ kg of beans in one sitting.

After a full cleanup, I pulled another shot of Jaguar Espresso ‚Äî same dose, same yield ‚Äî and had to move my grind size from 2.6 (pre-seasoning) to 3.8 (post-seasoning) to hit the same shot time. That tracks, since seasoning smooths/dulls the burr edges, and finer grinds now flow more easily.

To my surprise, there was a NOTICEABLE improvement. The shot was much smoother, FAR less acid-forward, and a bit sweeter. I was honestly shocked ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt buy into the seasoning ‚Äúhype‚Äù at first, but this was a clear, measurable shift (and my wife agreed in a blind taste test).

If you own a 078s, I‚Äôd recommend seasoning the burrs. I think 2.5‚Äì3 kg is plenty to unlock the improved flavor and grind consistency. The 7 kg recommendation floating around feels excessive (and incredibly wasteful), but I can‚Äôt speak to that personally. What I can say is that post-seasoning, dialing in is FAR easier. Before, a 0.1 click could make a massive difference on the grind size. Now, the dial feels much more forgiving and consistent.

Hope this helps someone else who's on the fence."

I got new stainless steel burs, new motor and belt , new board and many other things, a pretty substantial order for a total of about $220 (see attached screenshot of complete work order). The problem is since I got back the updated grinder,

I have a number of issues with the grinder after I got it back and I have been practically gotten stonewalled by their support staff. When I send them an email with questions, they would be no ETA of getting back to me and a couple of times they respond back after I let a couple of days go by and bother them again, but their response is some sort of canned response that has no relationship to what I am asking of them to help me with, and after that, total silence again.

In the last few days, I discovered that they have practically no phone support at all. You call and you hear a recorded message saying that they are so backed up that you can only use the web form to open a ticket.  
So my question to this community here is basically if they are familiar with Baratza as a company and whether my experience with them is typical and if anyone has any suggestions as to what I could do to have them respond and pay attention to my problems. I mean at this company I am thinking if there is a way to fight it even through my credit card company as a terrible customer service and a defective product.

This is an absolutely frustrating experience, never had a similar experience with the customer support of any other company in the US honestly and I wanted to ask this community if they have had prior experience with Baratza customer service and if they have any advice/tips that might help me get them to respond to my issues.

$57 - Bottomless 54 Normcore portafilter

$150 - sharador 64mm grinder Amazon (when I bought 8months ago had coupon clip was 119 total)

$6 - wdt tool Amazon 

$30 - 53mm tamp and distributer tool Amazon

$23 - crema 54mm dosing funnel

$27 - coffee scale Amazon 

$11 - mw bomber puck screen


Took a lot of lurking and YouTube videos to get here but I‚Äôm getting some pretty nice espresso 
‚òïÔ∏è with the right beans.  I‚Äôve found it nearly impossible to use dark roast on the bambino but medium roast works really well. 

Did waste 30 bucks on a sharador blade grinder in the beginning of my journey but honestly that thing still worked just not anywhere near as well as the burr grinder I have now - it did produce some decent shots ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è everyone said no but it actually did work and tasted pretty good just annoying to use compared to the burr grinder that goes right into my portafilter while I use the wdt to distribute and make sure it doesn‚Äôt over flow - it‚Äôs also way easier to dial in different beans with new grinder but if on a tight budget that blade grinder did actually work.

With this silverback of Rwanda bean from TJ‚Äôs I found using 19.5 grams in and pulling 37-40 grams out in 30 sec is the best. (Such a complex flavor beats any coffee shop I have been to and recently found out it‚Äôs on the lighter side of medium roast which is interesting)

When I use other beans 19.5 grams might not even fit in the basket, it‚Äôs strange how big of difference the beans make. Some beans I have had to use 21 grams some I have to go below 18 grams bc they fluff up and it‚Äôs too much volume. If I distribute through the funnel then distribute again I can get it to fit but it seems like that never gives me a good shot at the end of the day.

I stopped trying to buy dark roasts but might try again and see if not doing pre infusion helps - I have only done manual pulls with 7 sec pre infusion hold but recently thought maybe that‚Äôs not necessary for certain beans like dark roast and that might help get better shots. I had a dark roast choke the bambino out and the portafilter blew off so I stopped trying lmao (was fun experience)


I‚Äôm at a crossroads of whether to upgrade to a dual boiler like a rancilio pro x or lelit Elizabeth but don‚Äôt really know if I need to at this point bc bambino is so easy and fast - I‚Äôm sure I will at some point but think I ride this setup for at least another 6months to a year.  If I stick to the right beans i don‚Äôt see how much better an expensive machine could be but it would be nice to be able to grind finer and experiment with all beans and dial shit in.

The steam pressure on bambino kinda sucks that‚Äôs my only complaint ‚Ä¶ I got a 4 hole attachment off amazon and it works but not super well prob gonna go back to the 1 hole bc it takes longer but has better whirl-pooling and integration. I can get great latte art from time to time but it‚Äôs inconsistent bc it‚Äôs so hard to steam the milk properly every time. -main reason I would upgrade bc I love to make latte art.

Any other tips from non plus bambino owners out there ? Any recs on upgrade path?  

I was thinking about getting ssp 64mm burr upgrade at some point but only if I upgrade my machine bc I don‚Äôt think the bambino can really go finer than what I can already do with this stock sharador. Or I just sack up and get a nice grinder if I upgrade the machine but I feel like the ssp upgrade could be pretty good without dropping a grand idk. 

It‚Äôs been a year of fun and took hundreds of crappy pulls and spraying shots but it‚Äôs saved me and gf hundreds if not thousands I‚Äôm sure and it has been well worth the money spent ! Now when we rarely get coffee out it is actually enjoyable bc it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting bent over anymore. At 20 bucks a visit for 2 ppl  3 days a week min that‚Äôs like 100-300+ a month - such a joke and my worst espresso shits on 99% of the coffee shops anyways it‚Äôs ridiculous. - not to mention most places use the same bean for eternity and I still feel like they don‚Äôt have it dialed in (really nit-picky now when going out for coffee)

This setup is still gonna run about 400-500 depending on deals and cost of machine new or used but it‚Äôs so worth it. Takes some time to figure it all out but you‚Äôre still drinking coffee better than most places within a week - month depending on experience going in.   

- Home sick with a summer flu with nothing to do so I made this post. Hope this post helps someone out there in the same boat as me a year ago.

Today I finally added a GBW grinder to my setup. The objective was to enhance the workflow for my primary espresso beans. I started with single dosing when I got into espresso, but it never really did the trick for me. 

GBW, on the other hand, is amazing with the Libra 65 AP. After dialing in, it always hits the target within +- 0.1 g and makes the workflow extremely convenient. I also switched to grinding directly into the portafilter. I know that it's supposed to be better to grind into the dosing cup and then dump it in, but I tested it, and it didn't make a difference. 

Tastewise, the AP burrs are actually different from the ones in the Zero. For my beans, this is neither good nor bad. Just a little different. 

The plan for the Zero is to get repurposed to grinding beans for the AeroPress and V60.

The second grinder makes my station feel a little crowded, and I will need to declutter it a bit. But that's a task for later. Happy with my purchase.

I recently picked up a Delonghi EC230.BK because I was curious about how capable the machine was compared to my main machine (Elizabeth). And how good the espresso could be from a machine that comes in new at ¬£90. 

I was excited to deck it out with all the same accessories as my main machine so I picked up an IMS basket (DL2TH26E) and picked up a bottomless PF, funnel and tamper from aliexpress.

But almost everything I bought had compatibility issues. So I'm hoping this post will help people who find themselves with similar issue or maybe stop them from having them in the first place.

#Basket

The IMS basket I bought didn't fit in two ways.

First of all it was very loose in the stock basket which can be solved by taking out the retention spring and rending it be be a tighter fit.

Second, and more importantly the basket didn't fit over the group head gasket. It would only fit if forced and then would be stuck hard onto the group.

To remedy this I swapped the showerscreen and group gasket.

#Shower screen and group gasket

Another user really helped me out here by already doing the solution I thought might be possible. 
I swapped the EC series screen and gasket for the ECP series group and gasket (bought from 4delonghi). 

This paradoxically gives you a larger showerscreen that has a smaller diameter when the gasket is factored in, allowing the IMS basket to fit.

#Be wary of 3rd party Portafilters
 
I have a theory that most 3rd party portafilters risk damaging the plastic inserts in the EC and ECP series group.

This is because many of the 3rd party PFs use quite radically different geometry in the design of the wings on the PF. This slack fit and different wing width will give the PF the potential to engage in a way were one wing is properly engaged and one wing is pushing sideways on the insert (with MASSIVE force due to mechanical advantage).

This bad fit and partial wing engagement is catastrophic when paired with the fact the wings are interacting with plastic.

I've yet to find a 3rd party portafilter that has it's wing dimentions listed and that match that of the stock EC series PF. 

#Use the orignal PF

the orignal PF fits well. The spring can be bent to make 3rd party baskets fit tighter. And the bottom can be sawn off to make it bottomless. 


# Buy the ECP series instead if given the choice.

All the Mods done here don't need to be done with the ECP series. The basket will fit in the group and the stock portafilter and many of them have higher quality metal construction. The only downside is that the ECP series come with panarello wands unlike the EC230 and EC235."

The stock portafilter came with this weird colorization/oxidation that I have never been sure exactly of what it is. Can someone enlighten me what it is and if it's safe to drink out of?

Coming from a technical background in high pressure fluidics, it was actually quite fun to prepare and then extract, so I can totally see why people enjoy it so much.  I can also see why people can go a little crazy buying stuff they may or may not *need*.  Would it make sense to get a better grinder?  Are there any recommendations?

However, one of the most popular single dose grinders I see repeatedly is the DF54.

As such, I am unsure if this is due to 1) the nature of my conical burr niche zero 2) my dialing-in and taste buds, and I have been considering the possibility of a flat burr grinder.

I'm looking at the Mazzer Philos vs the option-o P64 - I like the p64 design better, but it's so much more expensive than the philos!!

After seeing some reviews and test results on the E24 it now seems like the Silvia is drastically more unstable in temp (comparatively), while the E24 is surprisingly stable with easy and consistent temp surfing to fit most roast levels, making PID for the E24 ""optional"", while being more of a requirement for the Silvia? The shower screen which was a drawback has also been improved.

So a more interesting discussion around this subject would be. In your opinion, at what price difference is the Rancilio a better option than the Gaggia, and what are the main things that seal the deal for you?

For me, coming from a thermoblock machine, the long warmup time of the Silvia is actually a pretty big drawback for me, especially since I only pull single shots 95% of the time, with milk drinks accounting for about 30% of my coffee. I have cupboards over my counter, so a top filled water tank will be a hassle, meaning the front access tank on the Gaggia is pretty neat. My main concern with the Gaggia is actually the portafilter availability. Longevity is very important, but even if the Silvia is better built, the Gaggia has a great track record for longevity. The Silvia is also almost $200 more than the Gaggia ($530 vs $730). I'm still hesitant though, fearing that I'll regret buying the Gaggia over the Silvia. I'm not afraid of modding (and I'm already planning on doing the OPV Spring mod almost instantly) but I'd also rather keep it stock if possible. PID and even Gagguino are great options for the future but at this time I'd rather not rewire and modify the machine, especially as long as it's within warranty."

I have the temperature set currently at \~105C, because as soon as I start running it, the temperature drops to \~100C.

I tested its pressure using one of those attachments for the portafilter and it jumps up and down, but averages 9 bars.

I'm using an IMS 18-20g basket. I use this weight as an indicator and take volume into consideration. I usually fit 18-19g. More than that and the coffee starts touching the shower screen.

My issue:  
I end up extracting 45g of espresso in 18-19 seconds, which, from what I've read, is way too fast. Because my beans are good, the coffee is mediocre. If I get really dark beans, then I can make a decent espresso, but with anything else I struggle a lot.

I assume I need to grind finer, but my grinder is struggling. I tried buying one of those puck screens because it should theoretically increase resistance, but it didn't make much of a difference in terms of speed of extraction. I tried buying a Fellow Opus, because people have recommended it for both espresso and brew coffee, but at the minimum setting it was way too coarse. I enjoy moka pots and v60 as well, so it's not a waste, but I really didn't manage to get it to work at all.

I'm looking for help! Is there something I'm doing wrong? What can I try to improve my speed of extraction?

Shots are blendy but way less monodimensional, they are more complex and ""aromatic"", I know the Eureka espresso burrs aren't a favorite for lighter roasts but I don't chase a high flavor separation in my espresso so they are working great for me

Coffee is ""La Playita House"" from Dalston in Spain, it's a medium roast honey processed red bourbon from Colombia with stated notes of cinnamon, honey and dates

I could go a touch finer to get a ""perfect"" shot but it was already a tasty one, biggest help in dialing in was following the advice in the EAf guide to first adjust the ratio and then fine tune the grind size üôèüèª"

the second post in my ""Coffee Deep Dive"" series focuses around Coffee Trade and Logistics. There will be a second part of this post coming over the weekend which will dive a bit deeper on the ""quirky"" stories around international coffee trade.

**Coffee is grown in over 70 countries, but production is concentrated in a few key regions.**¬†In 2024/25, world production was about¬†**174 million 60-kg bags**. South America (led by Brazil, the largest producer) accounts for the biggest share, while Asia (led by Vietnam) and Africa are also major contributors. Production can swing with weather and plant cycles - for example, Brazil‚Äôs biennial yield patterns caused a nearly 8% output jump that year. On the demand side,¬†**global consumption**¬†has been gradually rising, roughly matching supply around¬†**170 million bags**¬†annually. Notably, 2022/23 saw a slight¬†**2% dip in consumption to 173.1 million bags**¬†as economic pressures (inflation, lower incomes) tempered coffee drinking. Despite this blip, coffee‚Äôs popularity endures: the International Coffee Organization forecasts consumption to recover as global growth continues.

The global coffee market size was estimated at¬†**USD 269 billion in 2024**. Traditional markets in Europe and North America still drink the most, but¬†**new consumption trends**¬†are emerging.¬†**Specialty coffee**¬†is on the rise - urban youth and global middle classes are developing a taste for premium brews, driving growth in Asia and beyond.

I just recieved the grinder today after waiting months for it.  I know Timemore is doing a timed release to promote the grinder but it was kind of a pain in the ass dealing with them, to get my grinder here.  After pleading with them to just ship directly, to no avail, I ended up importing through a third party.  

The problem with that was they messed up the delivery address.  So after they finally shipped my grinder, I didn't see if for almost two weeks since I've been waiting for the courier to sort out timemore's labeling mistake.  This could have all been avoided, had they just shipped it to me directly in the first place.  

Rant aside, I did finally receive it today and I am thoroughly impressed with the build quality. This thing is very hefty.  For reference, I have pretty large hands, capable of gripping a basketball.  Coming from my Vssl grinder, the M01 feels right at home in my hands.  

It is also quote weighty, about twice the weight of my Vssl, at 1.1kgs.  The most unique feature of the grinder is its burrset, which Timemore is marketing as ""Pineapple Burrs.""  They are basically conical burrs but elongated, creating a 50% longer grind path than typical 40mm burrs.  In theory, the longer grind path is supposed to replicate the clarity of thd 64mm flat burrs on Timemore's Sculptor.

I'm not sure whether that holds up because I don't have any experience with the Sculptor.  What I can say is it definitely produces extremely high uniformity across grind settings.  Using a Leverpresso Pro as my preferred espresso machine, I have the benefit of varying pressure on the fly, allowing me yo avoid choking shots by increasing or reducing pressure.  

However, on my first shot with the M01, at setting 5, I managed to completely choke the shot.  That said, I imagine I can get 20 clicks of granularity in the espresso range with this grinder. 

I'm gonna make a more detailed video about this grinder after playing around with it for a bit.  I want to cup it against my Vssl and pull a few note shots with different coffees.  If anyone was interested in this grinder but frustrated about the lack of information, feel free to reach out. "

I'm glad I kept my old Gaggia around just in case.   The boiler on it is so tiny I forgot just how quickly it comes up to temp.   Shockingly my usual grind actually worked perfectly fine in it, though with extra steps--I don't feel like messing with my Mignon Libra, so I'm grinding into the PF for my Lelit and transferring over.   


Steaming?   Ouch.   That has to have been the biggest upgrade by far when I moved up to the Bianca.   The GCP incorporates poorly, takes forever to get milk to temp, and has so little movement that I can't use my regular pitcher (or milk quantity) with it unless I find something to prop the entire machine up higher.


I really hope the repair time has a quick turnaround."

**problem**

i got the flashing alerts that indicated the bambino needed to be descaled, as per the manual. i de-scaled, again following the manual, and afterwards it didn't seem to register as it started to give me the alternating single/double-dose flashing lights, indicating that i needed to do a cleaning cycle after 200 cups. i cleaned with cafiza, but the flashing lights never stopped. ended up doing a cleaning over 10 times, just trying to get rid of the flashing lights, but no matter how patient or how many different ways i tried, it wouldn't disappear.

i am not bothered by the flashing lights, as you can bypass it and i can manually decide when the clean. however, ever since this cleaning and de-scaling incident, the water flow has been totally different. if i tried to do the pre-programmed double cup as i used to do, it would release about \~140 ml of volume, with the machine thinking it was in cleaning mode still. 

**attempted solutions**

i decided to try and just do manual pulls, but now it reaches a 2:1 ratio within 14-15 seconds, despite no change in puck prep (grind size, tamp force, wdt/rdt, etc). have spent the last two weeks trying to fine-tune the puck prep, but nothing has worked. 

has anyone had an issue with this machine like this? i see all over reddit that people have trouble getting out of cleaning mode and i tried to follow all the other solutions, but nothing worked for me. upsetting as i had really enjoyed this machine so far. i bought it off marketplace unopened, so i don't have warranty. i did speak to breville customer support and they had recommended i try the same things other reddit users had posted, so no true solution there."

I'm testing several coffees (especially Giamaica Caff√®) with a Rocket R58 + Eureka Libra setup. I use the IMS B702TH24.5M filter and normally dose around 18g.

The doubt is:
with approximately 18.3g, the puck clearly touches the IMS shower head (also verified with the plasticine ball method). In the cup the result is good (dense cream, body ok), but sometimes I feel like it lacks a bit of complexity or is slightly ""compressed"".

I attach photos of the post-extraction puck where you can see the clear signs of the shower.
The gasket is new (silicone), the hand shower is IMS.

Requests:
	1. Does 18g in this filter seem too much?
	2. Is it better to go down to 17.5g to have more space and less compression, or switch to the 26.5mm filter even with 18g?
	3. Can the impact on the cup profile be significant if the coffee is too close to the shower head?

Thanks in advance, any advice is welcome!"

I‚Äôve been into the hobby for a few years now, I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to try a variety of different combinations of equipment and coffee types, and think I‚Äôm at a stage where I feel like I have a general idea of what I like.

90% of the time, what I make daily is a straight shot, typically the traditional 2:1 give or take a bit, and 1-2 v60‚Äôs. Generally, I‚Äôm buying med-light roasts, from a variety of roaster, lately I‚Äôve really enjoyed what I‚Äôve got from DAK. I think I fall somewhere in the middle of taste profile, I like the thick chocolatey syrup shots, but also clear fruit flavours. For pour overs I typically prefer something fruity, or an extremely clean well rounded and blended cup. I guess I appreciate and want both.

I‚Äôm looking to replace my DF64 Gen 2, as I‚Äôm not entirely happy with it. The two contenders for me right now are either the Lagom Casa (had one of the best cups ever with this thing) and a philos (seems like you get p64/Zerno quality coffee for less). I haven‚Äôt seen much in terms of comparison between the two, so I‚Äôm looking for opinions. I‚Äôm open to other suggestions though. I have an m47 and c40, so that‚Äôs swaying me towards the philos, mostly because I already have grinders with that conical profile, and don‚Äôt want to loose some of what the df gives me in terms of profile.

What I‚Äôm unsure of, however, is if water droplets are supposed to form on it when the pressure gauge is at the optimal pressure. 

I recently replaced the original high limit switch (held strong for 21 years) on the steam boiler and thought I‚Äôd take this chance to observe how the internals look with the machine running since it was already taken apart (checking for leaks etc). 

I noticed that sometime around the time the vacuum breaker valve pin pops up, some water droplets form on the top of the valve, which eventually boil off.

My question- are the water droplets in the video a normal occurrence? I was initially thinking of replacing only the seal on the valve with teflon tape and cleaning the valve. Should I replace the entire valve or is it not necessary? Would prefer not to do any unnecessary tinkering around since the machine is working perfectly and I anticipate the next few months to be extremely busy, professionally.

I'm looking to upgrade my home espresso machine, and the Elektra has been recommended. I want something that will not be temperamental, nor need too much idiosyncratic maintenance. I don't know too much about the brand but for $5000 is should be terrific.

It can be set up to turn on automatically each morning, and has volumetric programing, but I'm not sure it has a dual boiler.

I only make about 6 to 8 coffees a day, so production is not an issue.

Having just recently gotten into espresso at home I recently bought a breville dual boiler and varia vs3. Unfortunately the varia died within a month with a motor issue and I‚Äôve since done more research on it that I wish I had have done before the initial purchase. 

Anyway, I got a refund for it and looking at what I should buy instead. I‚Äôm debating either the DF64 or the Option-O Lagoma Casa. There is also the DF64V but I don‚Äôt really know the difference aside from an extra $200 (still below the $1000AUD budget)

From what I‚Äôve read the reviews for both are positive. The lagoma casa seems to have a slight edge but I‚Äôve seen one or two reviews stating it‚Äôs better for lighter roasters and bringing out the flavour and fruitiness but less so body, which better suits milk based drinks. 

I drink both black and milk based drinks but probably err moreso on piccolos and flat whites. What grinder should I go with?

My idea was that i might adjust the system a little but more or less, i can get a routine without using a scale at all. Quick and easy. I was completely wrong. The variation in the grinding result is unbelievable and ultimately renders the entire system unusable. E.g. I set the grinder to 11 seconds: First, I get the perfect 18g, two hours later it's 17.1 grams, and another hour later it's 15.8 grams. And without changing anything, it's back up to 18,5 grams....

I‚Äôve been using a De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica for a while now, paired with a decent grinder (Eureka Mignon). Over time, I‚Äôve had very mixed results, sometimes I manage to pull a surprisingly good shot of espresso, but other times it‚Äôs underwhelming, either sour, bitter, or just flat. It often feels like I‚Äôm gambling with every pull.

The main issue is that I have very limited control over the extraction, no pressure gauge, no PID, no real feedback. I can dial in as best as I can, but there‚Äôs always an element of guesswork, and it‚Äôs hard to know if a bad shot is due to grind size, tamping, temperature, pressure, or the machine itself.

That got me thinking, is it actually worth upgrading to something like a Profitec Go or another entry-level prosumer machine? Obviously, I‚Äôd gain more control over temperature and pressure, but what I really want to know is, aside from better control, will I see a clear difference in cup quality? Will the espresso consistently taste better, richer, more balanced?

If any of you have made a similar jump, I‚Äôd love to hear your experience. Was it a game-changer or more of a ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù? Any regrets or things to consider before making the investment?

When using flow profiling, I wonder if we could just grind as coarse as possible (or at least much coarset than usually) and then adjust flow with flow profiling instead of relying on the backpressure of the puck.

I mean, of course we could. I wonder what the results would be.

Does anyhone happen to know?
What are the theories of those who don't?
I plan to build a flow profiling capable system in the near future to then test it out, but I don't yet know."

(I realize the TDS isn‚Äôt as good as the Zero Water pitcher) Does anyone do this and if so, any experiences good or bad?

tl;dr - I change my water pitcher filter and BWT pad every 6 weeks. BWT pads are $17/ea when you buy in a 6 pack from WLL. Changing every 6 weeks I need \~9 a year so that‚Äôs $153. The Zero Water filters are $11/ea when I buy in packs of 4. Like the BWT filters, I need \~9 a year so that‚Äôs \~$99. So all-in, I‚Äôm currently spending around $250 a year on water treatment. It‚Äôs important to note that I use approximately 1 gallon of water a week. 

Doing the Third Wave Water math says that in year one says I can get 52 gallons of water from my local aquarium shop for \~$35 ($0.75\*47 gal, first 5 gal are free). Third Wave Water sells their box of 12, 5 gallon sachets for $28 (before any discounts)(5\*12=60gal of treated water) .

250,2025-07-25,Has home brewed espresso ruined coffee shops for anyone else?,u/BachelorFan69420,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m9484y/has_home_brewed_espresso_ruined_coffee_shops_for/,"Hey everyone,

Not sure if this is a me problem or if others here can relate, but I‚Äôve reached a point in my espresso journey where I genuinely can‚Äôt enjoy a shot unless every single variable is tuned with near-laboratory precision. I‚Äôm talking about espresso that only tastes good if I‚Äôve:

	‚Ä¢	Weighed my beans to the hundredth of a gram (18.20g exactly)

	‚Ä¢	Measured yield during extraction, not after‚Äî36.0g ¬± 0.3g

	‚Ä¢	Used a WDT tool with 0.3mm acupuncture needles in a 3D-printed pattern I custom-modeled for even density distribution

	‚Ä¢	Tapped the portafilter exactly three times on a silicone mat to settle the bed

	‚Ä¢	Calibrated tamp pressure to 30lbs using a force-sensing tamper (and I check it quarterly with a digital scale)

	‚Ä¢	Preheated my bottomless portafilter for 90 seconds in the grouphead (flush once at 5s, again at 45s, and a final time right before locking in)

	‚Ä¢	Monitored room temperature and barometric pressure because I swear it affects flow rate

	‚Ä¢	Used water I remineralized myself with sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate to mimic Rao/Perger water, mixed in a vacuum-sealed vessel to avoid CO‚ÇÇ exposure

	‚Ä¢	Verified the grind consistency using a Kruve sifter (I aim for 200‚Äì400 micron range with <15% fines)

	‚Ä¢	Pulled the shot on my Linea Mini with a 3-second pre-infusion at 2 bar, ramped to 9 bar over 4 seconds, then declined to 6 bar post-blonding

	‚Ä¢	Timed total shot duration to 29.7s‚Äîanything faster and it tastes hollow, anything slower and the florals vanish

	‚Ä¢	Logged the shot in my extraction spreadsheet (which has data from every shot I‚Äôve pulled since February 2023‚Äîcurrently 812 entries)

And I haven‚Äôt even started on the beans. If they‚Äôre not roasted between 6‚Äì9 days ago, vacuum-sealed in a nitrogen-flushed bag, and opened exactly 20 minutes before the first shot, I don‚Äôt even bother. I also use a rotating air drum de-gassing chamber (DIY build) to control CO‚ÇÇ levels before I grind.

Here‚Äôs the problem: when I don‚Äôt go through all of this, the espresso tastes flat, muddled, or just ‚Äúoff.‚Äù Not terrible, but not even close to what I know it could be. I‚Äôve tried relaxing, but when I drink a shot from someone‚Äôs Breville Express with pre-ground Lavazza and a pressurized basket, I physically can‚Äôt get through it. I honestly feel bad, but I just taste every flaw.

I‚Äôve also noticed that even micro-changes‚Äîlike a 0.1g dose variation or forgetting to swirl the demitasse before sipping‚Äîcompletely throw off the shot. Is this normal? Or have I completely ruined myself?

Would love to hear from others who‚Äôve gone way too deep and now struggle to enjoy 95% of espresso out there. Or maybe someone who found a way to pull back and just enjoy the process again without needing to reverse-engineer every variable?

(And before anyone asks: yes, I use a Weber EG-1 with SSP MP burrs and single-dose with bellows, RDT every time, and my distribution tool is aligned to within 0.1¬∞ using a laser guide.)"

5,2025-07-25,Cheapskate Setup,u/ADVandEdges,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m953am/cheapskate_setup/,"After watching tons of YouTube videos and doing some research I have arrived at this extremely minimal setup. I was super intimidated by the cost of espresso at first, but after tuning what I have here, I am happy I jumped down this rabbithole! I think this represents pretty much the minimal setup needed to pull some great shots. Altogether this was roughly $370 CAD total.

With the grinder on 7.1 clicks, my 13.7g filled basket is yielding 30gish out in about 28sec. With the milk froth tube removed, I'm getting some nice microfoam too, although I suck at art still. Very happy with the taste and texture, 10x better than normal coffee shops around me. Still honing it in but its allot of fun and very rewarding, I use sticky notes to keep track of what I'm doing.

Gear Breakdown:
Delonghi stilosa 3630 - $170
     Stainless steel boiler, manual controls, great size
Timemore Chestnut C3esp - $130
     Enough adjustment to dial in espresso, easy to use
Naked Portafilter, tamper, scale, etc - ~$70 
     Nameless cheapo stuff that does a great job.

Still using cheap beans, will look into that stuff once I get through what I have! Hopefully this is motivation for other background fence sitters, such as I was. I used to have a Nesspresso, which I have sold, I figure one year with this setup will equal that machine regardless. I'll have to grab a video next shot I pull. Cheers! "

I'm currently using a hand grinder. Looking for a little bit of an upgrade, still a tight budget so l have been looking at the DF55 and STARSEEKER E55.
A few differences I have noticed is that the STARSEEKER E55 is conical burr and DF55 is flat burr. DF55 also advertises an anti-static method.
My machine is a Rancilio Silvia which is 58mm portafilter.
From reviews I have seen the DF 55 plastic container to catch the coffee is 58 mm whereas the STARSEEKER is around 51 mm.

Actually I was alien to western coffees I am very good to cook Turkish coffee, cook and drink it since my high school era. I wanted to know other countries coffee(and nowadays Western coffee are common here) I am brewing and drinking filter coffee for one year, I wanted to experience moka pot and espresso. I ordered both moka pot and espresso machine, today moka pot arrived, I tried something:
1- one cup moka pot is just 60 ml, very little amount, one cup Turkish coffee is 90 ml.
2-Although I hate dark roast filter coffee, in moka pot dark roast is very delicious, yummy.
3-Although I am medium roast filter coffee fan, I found medium roast is very bad on moka pot. (a barista in coffeeshop roasted and ground all my coffees for moka pot)

A week ago I got a DF54 grinder and tested the zero point and everything was good. The issue that I‚Äôm having is that I can see charts and videos of people having to grind about #16-20 for espresso while I‚Äôm here doing #5-0 grind size just to get to espresso size and get proper pressure. I‚Äôm using specialty coffee that was roasted about 20 days ago and I had the same issue even with the more forgiving coffee beans so I don‚Äôt think the issue is the beans, If someone has any insight into what could be causing it I would really appreciate the help.

I‚Äôm new to the world of espresso and have been loving it so far. I bought a J-ultra, IMS basket and a Bambino plus. I‚Äôve managed to dial in my espresso pretty okay (my crema always varies, but flavor is out of this world compared to my previous superauto machine).

A good reason why I bought the new bambino plus is the auto-Milq technology. I wanted to learn Latte art technique with the knowledge that my frothing was not going to be a variable. After I got my pour down, I wanted to work on manual frothing to learn how to froth and pour like a pro.

The problem is - I can‚Äôt seem to get a grasp on how to froth. The machine has a little sensor on the bottom and I put my Breville jug on top of it with the wand at the back - so as to make absolutely sure the jug is covering the sensor. I pour a healthy amount (between the two lines) and click froth (froth: 3/3 and temp: 2/3). I use whole milk only and I let it go until it decides to stop. Every time I do that, the milk gets frothy but definitely way too hot to the touch. I tried doing it today until it was hot to the touch and I had no microfoam at the top.

Multiple times now I have had the milk boil over the top of the jug, and when I‚Äôve tried to do it manually I never get that ‚Äúwhite paint‚Äù consistency.

I have tried pouring into other cups and back into the jug, banging it on the table, and it never comes out right.

I have pretty good crema with a yield of around 40g. and I try to pour about 60g of milk before getting closer to the cup.

I have a friend with a tricked out Gagguino. He told me there‚Äôs a learning curve to every beginner and every machine. Does anyone else have a bambino plus and can help give me some tips on my workflow/setup to finally get good lattes + latte art? I usually end up using 4 cups (all tasting horrible) then giving up and using my superauto + Aerochino 3. I make Wonderful latte macchiatos that way, but I would sure like to learn how to use a wand as I grow into the espresso hobby.

Thanks! All the best. Eli"

I was all in on buying the Zero Grinder. The base price is already steep at $689, but then‚Äîout of nowhere‚Äîthey tack on a 35% markup for shipping/handling. That‚Äôs an extra $250 I didn‚Äôt consent to upfront. No clear breakdown, no transparency. They just charge it and you‚Äôre supposed to accept it. Suddenly, I‚Äôm looking at a ~$950 grinder I didn‚Äôt budget for.

To top it off, if I return it, they keep $70 as a return fee to cover the shipping they didn‚Äôt disclose in the first place. What kind of clown world logic is that?

So yeah, I‚Äôm out on the Zero, because no 64mm grinder should cost nearly a grand unless it‚Äôs hand-delivered by James Hoffman himself.

What I need now:
- A high-quality single-dosing grinder that pairs well with an E61 machine (I‚Äôm using the Diletta Alto).
- Fast workflow, clean retention, no-nonsense build.
- Budget ideally sub-$700 (USD).
- Bonus points if the company doesn‚Äôt sneak in $250 worth of hidden shipping charges üôÉ

Current considerations: Lagom Mini? DF64 Gen 2? Something else I should look at? Maybe the All Ground even. I know that‚Äôs $1,400 but at this point wtf‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôm basically there with the tariff.

I purchased the **Mahlk√∂nig X64 SD** from **La Barista** with high expectations. It‚Äôs a premium grinder from a reputable brand, and I expected performance to match. Unfortunately, the reality was completely different ‚Äî a series of issues and disappointments.



**1. Underwhelming performance + useless instructions**

Right from the start, the results were far below what you‚Äôd expect from a grinder in this price range. Grind consistency was poor, directly affecting espresso quality ‚Äî even with top-quality beans and careful dialing in.

To make it worse, the user manual **includes no explanation at all** about how to **calibrate or fine-tune the grinder**. A technical product like this should come with proper documentation.¬†



**2. Incompetent and misinformed technical support**

After receiving the grinder and facing issues, I contacted **La Barista** for assistance. Unfortunately, their support was **vague, incorrect, and completely unhelpful**. It was clear they **didn‚Äôt understand the grinder or how it works**.

To help them understand, I even **sent detailed photos** showing exactly what I was dealing with. Later, when a **third-party YouTube video** explained the calibration process properly, I **shared that with them too** ‚Äî hoping they‚Äôd finally grasp the issue. They didn‚Äôt.



**3. Refund request ‚Äî completely ignored**

Given the poor performance and lack of proper support, I requested a **refund on July 13**. Since then, I‚Äôve gone through endless **calls, emails, and follow-ups** ‚Äî all without resolution.

Whenever I do get someone on the phone, they simply say *‚Äúwe‚Äôll handle it in the afternoon‚Äù*‚Ä¶ but **nothing ever happens**.



**4. No accountability whatsoever**

What‚Äôs most disappointing is the **complete lack of responsibility** from La Barista. They sold a high-end product without knowing how to support it, and now refuse to take ownership of the issue or honour a legitimate refund request.

To make matters worse,¬†**they‚Äôve now disappeared from Instagram**, removing yet another way for customers to reach out or share feedback publicly. Even my honest review was¬†**deleted**¬†‚Äî instead of being addressed.

‚∏ª

The manufacturer is now¬†**reviewing the situation and contacting La Barista directly**. I appreciate their willingness to help ‚Äî but it‚Äôs unfortunate that it had to reach this point.

‚∏ª

**Conclusion:**

**La Barista** claims to sell high-quality equipment, but my experience has shown otherwise. They lack the **technical knowledge, transparency, and professionalism** expected from a serious retailer.

If you‚Äôre considering buying from La Barista ‚Äî **think twice**.

What should‚Äôve been a safe and exciting investment became a **deeply frustrating experience**."

Currently have a Breville (Sage) oracle and have been using the integrated grinder (conical) and mostly using medium blends. I enjoy richer flavours and syrupy espresso but have started experimenting with lighter single-origin roasts recently.

I know it will be a big change due to the difference in quality of grinders, so I want to know which burr set will more naturally produce the taste I‚Äôm used to.

4,2025-07-26,Advice needed for deciding [Rancilio Silvia Pro X vs Bezzera Duo DE],u/SnooTangerines6269,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m9qfop/advice_needed_for_deciding_rancilio_silvia_pro_x/,"I currently have a Rancilio Silvia V5 and an Eureka Mignon Silenzio. Super happy with the reliability of both and would love to be able to move faster when making a cappuccino -> dual boiler.

A few details:

1. I normally pull a double shot, split it between me and my wife, milk x2 = 2 cappuccinos twice a day.
2. The ideal machine would have stainless steel boilers and no PTFE in the wands. 
3. E61 group seems a bit overkill for my needs?

So far, I‚Äôve narrowed it down to: rancilio silvia pro x and the bezzera duo de. Lelit Bianca V3 could also be an option but not comfortable with the PTFE inside the wands and, if removed, will the inside of the wands be food safe? They were not thought to be used without the PRFE tubing.

Price points (including shipping):

1. Silvia Pro x - 1350Eur
2. Bezzera Duo DE - 1650Eur
3. Bianca V3 - 1900Eur


What‚Äôs your thoughts on this?

My mind says: I already have a small silvia, might want to go for a visual change? Duo DE seems interesting and my wife would absolutely love the dosage option. Bianca offering a bit too much for the price plus the wands topic."

However, I find that even though I use the same 19.5g and grind setting (DF54) each time, my final shot can vary by a few ml, and sometimes even by 10ml!? 

For example, yesterday I did 19.5g beans, WDT, tamp, 62ml extraction setting and I got a final shot of 42ml. Very minimal spray on my bottomless. 

Today I did same settings and workflow, but it choked a bit at first and then didn't spray AT ALL, but final shot of 32ml. 

I'm confused, should I use less in my basket (maybe 19?) with same grind settings, or same 19.5g beans with a slightly coarser setting, or just keep everything the same and do manual extraction every time to ensure I hit at least 40ml final shot? 

I just don't get it because today with zero spray on bottomless looked like an amazing sign to me, but if I lessen my beans to 19, would that promote spraying?"

We've just purchased a Rocket Appartamento from a local, for what felt like a good price. 

We've used another Rocket machine elsewhere and thought it would be a great machine for at-home espresso.

We'd been told that it had been recently serviced locally to the tune of \~¬£200.

However, it doesn't seem to be running properly; the water doesn't seem to go through the overflow pipe (not sure what it's actually called), although some seems to be leaking out of the top connection.

Has anyone else had this issue with this machine or similar?

I took apart this bit underneath the gasket and cleaned it with hot water and machine cleaner to make sure there was nothing blocking it. 

When I flushed the system without the overflow pipe, water came out through it (and none into the portafilter). 

Based on this: [https://wiki.wholelattelove.com/images/4/41/Appartamento\_Parts\_Diagram.pdf](https://wiki.wholelattelove.com/images/4/41/Appartamento_Parts_Diagram.pdf)

It seems as though we might be missing an O-ring (part 9).

Would love to know if there's a semi-simple fix to this before I try and return it (if possible).

After using the blind filter, the pressure can't seem to escape from the portafilter through the overflow pipe, and it was difficult to release.

Let us know if there are any details missing.

Any advice or suggestions are appreciated. Thank you.

Here‚Äôs the catch. I‚Äôm completely new to espresso. I have no hands-on experience making espresso or evaluating machines, so I‚Äôm not sure what to look or listen for when I go check it out.

Questions:
	1.	What should I look for or test to make sure the machine is working properly?
	2.	Are there common issues with the BES920XL that I should be aware of?
	3.	Is $450 CAD a fair price assuming it‚Äôs in good working condition?
	4.	Is this machine a good option for a beginner or should I be looking at something more basic?

Any advice, checklists, or even red flags to look out for would be super helpful. I want to make sure I‚Äôm not buying a machine that will need expensive repairs or is too complex for a beginner.

2. With a 16.5g dose, my extraction time is 34s to get 45ml out. (I know 34s is on the longer side, but the Bambino seems to have a very slow preinfusion -- about 13s.)
3. I have a bottomless portafilter and the shot looks good, no sputtering or apparent signs of channeling.
4. My beans were roasted a little over a month ago. I know this could be better, but it doesn't seem it should be a deal breaker on its own. It's a medium-dark roast from Andytown (https://andytownsf.com/products/wind-sea-blend-2).

And yet, my shots still taste sour and perhaps underextracted. Given (2) and (3), it seems like I'm grinding fine enough, right? What's likely going on? Is it just that the roast is too light, so the beans naturally taste acidic and the Bambino can't fully extract them?"

I recently had some Lavazza from a friends Breville and it clicked that my espresso doesn‚Äôt even taste similar, doesn‚Äôt even taste like coffee. They let me borrow their machine.

I used my niche, TWW espresso water, the same Lavazza super crema, BBE NON double wall basket, and I could only fit like 14g in the double basket from the BBE when grinding direct from Niche (didn‚Äôt have funnel or any other accessories), but while dialing in a couple shots 14g in to 28g out anywhere between like 20s to 38s and it was all solid tasting. I then switched back to my GO trying to replicate and it is tasting nowhere close with all the same parameters. I‚Äôm worried that since it was my first machine I just went in circles for ages. 

I had contacted whole latte love this past week and they just suggested I do the barista assist zoom call, I‚Äôll probably still go through with that for good measure but I‚Äôm pretty confident now something it up with my machine, since I dialed in on the BBE with literally zero effort.

Anyway, just wanted to share and see if anyone can see if I might be missing something obvious but I‚Äôm probably gonna try and send my GO back (I don‚Äôt want to sell if it‚Äôs broken) and have them check it out if possible and maybe just get a new machine.

72,2025-07-26,Endgame Coffee Corner,u/Walsbinatior,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ma14vk/endgame_coffee_corner/,"I think I have maxed out what my portion of the counter top can handle. If I ever get the upgrade itch now I have to move.

Finished the setup off with the Wug2 m1 motor kit for my HG1. Perfectly pairs with the Londinium Vectis for the most quiet setup and the tastiest lattes.

Things I like about this setup:

-Super quiet, no pump in the spring lever so the brewing process is completely silent. The HG1 was already pretty silent, the m1 mod kit doesn‚Äôt not change that, the motor itself is quieter than the sound of the beans being ground, I can even lower the speed if I need to make it even quieter.

-tactile feel of the spring lever gives infinite dopamine.

-m1 motor kit saves me from pulling the HG1 out of the corner and sliding it back everyday plus it now ads a lot more consistency as I can set the motor speed. Grinding by hand was very rewarding but you can‚Äôt grind with perfect consistency so sometimes you could affect the shot.

-The HG1 has very little retention, perfect for single dosing as long as you use RDT. As you can see in the background I am an avid user of dosing vials. 

-Being a spring lever, you only need 1 boiler to allow for steaming and brewing at the same time. With the motor kit for the HG1 and pre weighing beans, you can make a latte super quick.

Down sides of this setup:

- The Vectis has a pretty small boiler (1.5L) you can really only make 4-5 drinks before needing to refill the machine. This also sucks cause you can‚Äôt refill it while pressurized since you need to add water directly to the boiler. On a day today day basis, I don‚Äôt notice this much, refilling every morning is a little annoying but doesn‚Äôt take very long and you can do it will starting to heat up. However, hosting can be annoying cause you can‚Äôt pump out drink after drink.

-While spring levers can make some amazing espresso you can‚Äôt play with the profile too much. Something by like a decent or gagguino gives you far greater control.

-I used to have a high rpm hopper fed grinder, the convenience of sticking the portafilter in and grinding in 5s was incredible. The difference with the HG1 and m1 motor is not life changing, however it is noticeable better in terms of taste and consistency. 

-Decently expensive. My previous set up was a bambino and Compak e5 that I got off marketplace. Paid $700 total for that setup. This setup I also got completely used on marketplace (aside from the m1), though it cost me $4200. The quality of life and taste are better with this new setup, but not 6x better. 

If you have read all of this, please give me your thoughts. We all have different ideas of what our endgames look like its easy to want to best hear available, but it‚Äôs also interesting to see what the minimum gear it would take to reach your most important features."

11,2025-07-26,Titus Hybrid 68 grinder,u/DaveWpgC,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ma1lci/titus_hybrid_68_grinder/,"I've read lots of opinions about this grinder here & on other forums but there are very sparse details about pricing, finishes, options, add-ons etc. I communicated with Frank Durra and this thread will hopefully fill in some of the blanks. Frank might send me some corrections if I get anything wrong.

Originally introduced 2014, Titus builds approximately 15 of the Hybrid 68 grinders, 30 of Nautilus & 20 Nimbus per year. It's just him & one other person & 2 hourly helpers. The focus is on quality grinders rather than volume. Although it's not listed, there is a lifetime warranty on the grinder. If the motor or the transmission/moving parts fail you can just ship the grinder back to be fixed. You place your order & you're given an estimated completion date. No deposit was asked of me, payment due when the grinder is ready. Shipping to Canada was 250‚Ç¨/$295 USD. I ordered 7/25 and expect it to be shipped end of September.

Dimensions of the grinder are 16cm W x 26cm D x 35cm H, weight is 18kg.

The burrs are referred to as hybrid as they combine 68mm conical & flat burrs, sometimes called DRM. They are ZrN coated (zirconium nitride). (first image)

For seasoning Frank finds they always work out of the box, just static charge improves over time. He does some seasoning (1-2 kgs) to make sure everything runs correctly.

The OLED display, configurable by USB slot on the rear is mounted to a shunt on the inside which reads all of the data. The OLED is over 200‚Ç¨/$235 USD and the shunt 80‚Ç¨/$95 USD in the cost of the machine. Machining the side for the display is very costly as well.

Grinder options - basically all variants of the grinder are mechanically identical, the finish is something that you can change. Each model has a portafilter holder with adjustable height & torque. Grind speed is variable 190-565 rpm. Does not come with a power supply, you must purchase one for your specific country. For North America it costs $90 US (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GSK6CHL?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) The power supply can be placed anywhere within reach of the grinder. The power connection on the grinder is water proof, dust proof and very strong. You could lift up the grinder by just the cable.

Unlike some grinders Titus does not come in a powder coating finish. It messes up the gap dimensions, looks cheap & is much cheaper. The cost to powder coat the entire grinder is 30‚Ç¨/$35 USD whereas the cost for DLC is 1,000‚Ç¨/1,175 USD. The cost to apply a mirror polish is additional. The gap dimensions on the Titus are in the 100ths of a mm range.

The grind adjustment has a locking mechanism latch that ensures proper burr alignment bringing the burrs into maximum parallel position. It needs some force applied and is the key to proper alignment. The shaft is made of titanium grade 5.

Second photo is the standard variant, 7,000‚Ç¨/$8,200 USD. This is completely plated finish.
 
Third photo is a combination finish. It's a mix of DLC & plated. It costs 7,500‚Ç¨/$8,800 USD. 

Other options are Red Speed & plated 7,400‚Ç¨/$8,700 USD, Red Speed & DLC finish, 7,800‚Ç¨/$9,150 USD, all DLC finish 8,000‚Ç¨/$9,400 USD and Damascus steel 14,000‚Ç¨/$16,450 USD.

There are add-on hoppers, 200g and 1kg. The 200g hoppers costs an additional 850‚Ç¨. (last image)

I have a few suspects:

First, the DF64E. I use it only in single dose mode. Even at the zero mark, I don‚Äôt hear the burrs touching. Is this common with this model? Could something be wrong? I‚Äôm hesitant to fully zero it since the process looks rough and might void the 1-year warranty.

Second, the scale. I suspect my current scale isn‚Äôt accurate. I‚Äôm planning to get a new one. Are those small timemore or MHW-3Bomber pocket scales accurate enough?

Third, the beans. I bought them from an outdoor market where they store them in large open containers. Even though it‚Äôs a specific roast with stated parameters, there‚Äôs a chance they mix old and new batches.

Any input from people who had similar issues would be appreciated. Trying to narrow down the cause."

My husband and I have a two month old and accordingly, we are drinking a lot of coffee. Namely, we‚Äôre spending a lot of money on espresso drinks out. So we figured - let‚Äôs just get a home set up! 

We‚Äôre total beginners, so I had researched and landed on a Bambino Plus and Encore ESP, with an upgraded portafilter/basket from Crema, a tamper from Normcore, and maybe some other things (distribution tool? WDT? Puck filters?!). Was hoping to keep our total initial setup under $1k. 

And then - after going through all this, looking at all the steps to dialing in - I thought, is this what we need in this season? Most mornings we need to make our drinks and get out the door. Efficiency is key here! Once we have our process for dialing in down - is this realistic? Or is the process meant to always make you slow down and smell the roses (which we don‚Äôt have a lot of time for in this season). 

If a home espresso setup is not for two very busy people, are there other ways we can upgrade from our crummy Ninja machine that would allow us to make espresso-like drinks? Aeropress? Moka pot? If we‚Äôll likely be set once we know how to dial in - thoughts on the equipment I mention above for beginners? 

For context - we both like both straight espresso or Americanos along with milk drinks, so versatility is great. 

Hopefully this is coherent enough to make sense‚Ä¶and thanks in advance for your advice! "

I can find it on the Amazon US store for 499. I am sure that the machine itself will suffer from all the issues manual machines without a PID have, but it seems to eb a step on the right direction as I feel that it takes elements from all the machines currently in the market and consolidates them into a single product. The build looks solid, and the brand itself seems to have decent reviews for other items of their catalogue, so I guess that as long as the initial product received is in working order, it would last for a with only the seals having to be replaced periodically. 

  
I really like the use of a portafilter and also the two levers as it means a smaller footprint than F58 and a better workflow than a Robot. The construction seems to be robust being mostly metal except for seals, which is also something I would have liked to see from ROK, and pricing seems very competitive considering all the things it has to offer. 

I guess this is a solid choice specially outside of the USA market since tariffs raise the price and also, other options specially to south America are a bit cost prohibitive due to import duties and shipping costs. "

I recently moved overseas and had to part ways with my old setup (Breville Bambino + SGP + a cheap drip machine). I‚Äôm now planning to build a new home coffee setup and could really use some input from the community. 

I‚Äôve already purchased an automated pour-over-like drip machine, and I‚Äôm planning to get a Gaggia Classic Pro E24 soon. As for the grinder, I‚Äôm between two Eureka grinders. 

I‚Äôll be single dosing everything. Weigh in, grind, purge, brew. I‚Äôll use the grinder for roughly 60% pour-over/drip and 40% espresso. The budget is tight, but I‚Äôm willing to stretch it if the upgrade is truly worth it. Grinder options are quite limited in the country I live in, so I‚Äôve narrowed it down to these two: Eureka Oro Single Dose Pro (‚Ç¨688) or Eureka Mignon Crono + Specialit√† 55mm Burr Upgrade + Eureka Single Dose Kit which includes single-dose hopper, bellows, catch cup, and portafilter fork (‚Ç¨392). 

My questions and concerns are:
1. Since Crono is designed for filter, is the motor strong and consistent enough for espresso, especially after the burr upgrade? 
2. How does the Specialit√† burr upgrade compare to the Oro Pro‚Äôs burrs? 
3. Will switching beans often (filter vs. espresso) be a hassle? 
4. How bad is retention and purging on the modded Crono setup? 
5. Is the Oro really worth the price difference in terms of workflow, consistency, and long-term value? 
6. Has anyone here used the modded Crono for both espresso and filter with minimal fuss? Any regrets?

Unfortunately, due to tax and shipping constraints, I can‚Äôt get the Niche Zero. 

Thanks a lot in advance!

I recently picked up a Delonghi EC230.BK because I was curious about how capable the machine was compared to my main machine (Elizabeth), [spoiler it's very capable](https://imgur.com/a/miU9yjN). And how good the espresso could be from a machine that comes in new at ¬£90. 

I was excited to deck it out with all the same accessories as my main machine so I picked up an IMS basket (DL2TH26E) and picked up a bottomless PF, funnel and tamper from aliexpress.

But almost everything I bought had compatibility issues. So I'm hoping this post will help people who find themselves with similar issue or maybe stop them from having them in the first place.

#Basket

The IMS basket I bought didn't fit in two ways.

First of all it was very loose in the stock basket which can be solved by taking out the retention spring and rending it be be a tighter fit.

Second, and more importantly the basket didn't fit over the group head gasket. [It would only fit if forced and then would be stuck hard onto the group.](https://imgur.com/a/ec230-bk-wTBHKUw)

To remedy this I swapped the showerscreen and group gasket.

#Shower screen and group gasket

Another user really helped me out here by already doing the solution I thought might be possible and [posting it to home barista](https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/delonghi-ecp-series-stilosa-all-variants-t99450-30.html). 
I swapped the EC series screen and gasket for the ECP series group and gasket (bought from 4delonghi). 

This paradoxically gives you a larger showerscreen that has a smaller diameter when the gasket is factored in, allowing the IMS basket to fit.

#Be wary of 3rd party Portafilters
 
I have a theory that most 3rd party portafilters risk damaging the plastic inserts in the EC and ECP series group.

This is because many of the 3rd party PFs use quite [radically different geometry](https://imgur.com/a/fvOo5wC) in the design of the wings on the PF. This slack fit and different wing width will give the PF the potential to engage in a way were one wing is properly engaged and one wing is pushing sideways on the insert (with MASSIVE force due to mechanical advantage).

This bad fit and partial wing engagement is catastrophic when paired with the fact the wings are interacting with plastic.

I've yet to find a 3rd party portafilter that has it's wing dimentions listed and that match that of the stock EC series PF. 

#Use the original PF

the original PF fits well. The spring can be [bent to make 3rd party baskets fit tighter](https://imgur.com/a/JIVvUz7). And the bottom can be sawn off with a hacksaw to make it bottomless, takes about 30min if you have something to hold it steady while you saw. 


# Buy the ECP series instead if given the choice.

All the Mods done here aside from sawing the bottom off of the stock PF don't need to be done with the ECP series. The basket will fit in the group and the stock portafilter and many of them have higher quality metal construction. The only downside is that the ECP series come with panarello wands unlike the EC230 and EC235.

I'll update this in the comments as I learn more or am corrected."

 Pictures show my step by step. (Weigh out 17g medium roast beans, spritz with water, shake, dump in grinder, measure, wdt tool, tamp) 
Before I transfer the grounds to the basket , I run a shot of water and then wipe basket with a cloth.  

I‚Äôve tried making a finer grind setting to fix this but I still end up with completely different yields with the same variables. Some over extracted and others under extracted.

Any advice is appreciated  "

Everything combined came out at roughly 300‚Ç¨. Should be decent. 
But the coffee I have is terrible; constantly lowering the grind size and getting about 32g of coffee in 16 seconds, sour and oily. I'll figure it out 
The only downside is - I drink espresso and espresso based drinks only on the weekends at home, on the workdays I can't make espresso before work (work from 7AM to 3PM) and after work is usually too late for coffee. I have hashimoto's and can't drink coffee for at least 30 minutes after medication which I take when getting up in the morning, before work. At work I have Dolce Gusto, Philips Senseo, drip coffee, usually one short at about 7:30 and a drip or double senseo after breakfast at about 11. I might start doing espresso daily at ~4 PM after lounch. Or should I do cappuccino?"

I also really love Illy, but I ordered direct from them and it was all roasted like a year or some before I got it, it degrades immediately after opening.

And then Counter Culture is pretty good, not my favorite but decent.

I had a guy locally that was probably one of the best roasters I‚Äôve tried, and he got a Guatemalan that was hands down the best coffee I‚Äôve had he could have sold it for $50+ a bag like how Bean & Bean does. Theirs is the closest I‚Äôve ever found and I‚Äôve tried lots of other Guatemalans from other roasters. And Ethiopian is good like from Counter Culture, sometimes it‚Äôs better than others.

I actually typically make moka pot coffee, but I have access to everything from a french press to an espresso machine. I'd love a grinder that could be at least reasonably suitable for all of these methods.

I‚Äôve done a bunch of research on how to dial in. I‚Äôve got a pretty good idea on when to increase and decrease brew temp and grind size. I have medium fresh roasted beans (10 days) and I plan to buy some dark roast online as I can‚Äôt find any locally that are fresh dark roast, because I understand this machine struggles below dark roast. I‚Äôm using everything that came with the machine, and no external scales or anything (I do have a puck screen on the way). All of my shots are coming out sour and bitter. I‚Äôm thinking the machine can‚Äôt get hot enough for these beans and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm ordering some online. I‚Äôd like to be able to drink a black shot, but none of the shots I pull are very good alone, but they‚Äôre still way better with some milk than anything from the Kuerig. 

I think part of the issue in dialing in is that I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever had a great/perfect shot as a baseline to dial into as far as bitterness/sourness are concerned. So I‚Äôm not too sure what to do about that other than going to a local shop and trying their espresso and hoping it‚Äôs a good baseline. Another part I think is the medium roast I‚Äôm using since it‚Äôs the only fresh beans I could find so hopefully fresh dark roast online helps. And then lastly, I fear I may outgrow this machine as I tend to get very into things like this as a hobby. For example, when I bought my first home I became obsessed with lawn care. I think the same is happening here and I want to make sure I don‚Äôt go crazy but I also want to consider that maybe this machine isn‚Äôt a great fit if I want more flexibility in roasts. Can other machines pull good shots with store bought non fresh beans? If so, maybe I‚Äôd prefer that flexibility as a convenience over the process convenience of the luxe cafe. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for guidance, maybe a chat with someone that has experience, a bit of a mentor maybe to help guide me in getting experience and helping me determine some decisions or how to quickly move forward with understanding if this is the right machine for me and my wife (3-4 drinks a day, nothing past 2pm) or if there‚Äôs a better investment we should make

Im using one of Kicking Horse‚Äôs dark roasts, 18g:38g for a ~56g doubleshot. Grinding at 4 on the dial for the K-Ultra.

I dont remember the exact pull time from this morning, but it was less than 20 seconds. I wanna say 10-15. Its not HORRIBLE but also its not coming out with the crema and fullness Im looking for. 

Theres nothing I can really do to adjust pressure or water flow on the machine itself, so I guess if anyone has advice on shot prep, grind settings with the K-Ultra, or maybe even different recs for baskets or tampers?

3 other espresso machines recently listed on his page, past few days. I don't know where he gets all of them from but in the description of one he says hes getting rid of it for more room in his collection, this one because his mom wants a bambino touch.

I'm concerned about longevity, no idea how much or how long its been used. & is the price alright? It's marked as being in excellent condition & he has videos of everything functioning.

Remember when we used to just... drink coffee? Yeah, me neither. So I built **Coffee Shot Timer** - because why have one obsession when you can have TWO? 

**What it does (so far):**
- ‚è±Ô∏è Timer with color-coded feedback (red = panic, green = zen master)
- ‚öñÔ∏è Weight tracking with auto brew ratio calc (because math is hard at 6am)
- üìä Shot analytics (yes, I chart my caffeine intake like a stock portfolio)
- ‚òï Bean management with freshness tracking (RIP to all my stale beans)
- üìù Tasting notes (90% of mine just say ""needs more coffee"")

**Coming soon‚Ñ¢ (aka my weekend coding adventures):**
- üì± Smart scale integration (because manual input is SO 2024)
- ü§ù Bean sharing with friends (spread those Single Origin recommendations!)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud sync service (your coffee data, everywhere you caffeinate)
- üî¨ Intelligent extraction suggestions (ü§ñ telling you your shots suck, but politely)

**The ask:** I'm in closed testing and need fellow coffee nerds to break my app! üî® Looking for feedback, bug reports, and general ""this is dumb because..."" comments. Fair warning: I respond to feedback with the enthusiasm of a golden retriever who just heard the word ""walk.""

DM me if you want to help a dad turn his caffeine addiction into a slightly more organized caffeine addiction! 

**Disclaimer:** App may cause increased coffee snobbery, spontaneous grinder upgrades, and the uncontrollable urge to lecture people about extraction theory. Side effects include better espresso and emptier wallets. üí∏

*P.S. - Yes, I know there are other timer apps. But did THEY let me procrastinate on real work for 2 weeks straight? I think not!* üò§

I found myself with too many pieces of paper and complicated Excel sheets with my coffee notes. It was getting chaotic  - and my partner was getting angry...  So I created an app that allows you to track and rate your coffee.

The idea is simple: you log your shots (parameters like grind size, dose, extraction time, etc.) to gradually improve your shots over time. I found this especially challenging when I had multiple coffees at home that I used in parallel.

I know there are already apps out there that can do this, so honestly, I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs even a need for yet another one. But I wanted to put this out there to anyone who might want a lightweight, free option that works on any device (Desktop, iOS, Android).

I've been building [spro.so](http://spro.so) a website to track, discover, and share great coffee.

**My Problem:** I got sick of tracking coffees by hoarding old bags, and struggled to find my next bag without giving up control to subscriptions. Plus, I'd stare at a $25 bag that just says ""grape soda, lilac funk"" with no idea of if I would actually enjoy it.  

 **For tracking your coffee journey:**

*  Build your own coffee journal with detailed brew parameters
*  Add coffees to your **drank list**, **favorites**, and **want list**
*  Rate and review each coffee you drink
*  Save and share recipes (we both have a DF64? Let me steal your grind setting/dose!)

  For discovering new coffees:

* Browse by variety, roaster, process, country, or flavor notes
* Use advanced search to find ""**natural process**"" + ""**Colombia**"" + ""**chocolatey**""
* Flavor matching to find similar coffees to ones you love

   
Technically we're in open beta and I would love to get some r/espresso users testing what I've built and providing any feedback you have. The flavor matching system is pretty solid, and the recipe sharing could be a game-changer for dialing in new beans, and I'm really excited!

My Setup:
	‚Ä¢	Grinder: Baratza Encore ESP
	‚Ä¢	Machine: DeLonghi EM450
	‚Ä¢	Neouza 51mm bottomless portafilter
	‚Ä¢	Dose: 17.5g
      ‚Ä¢	Medium+Dark Roast
	‚Ä¢	Yield: ~38g
	‚Ä¢	Shot Time: Always ~14 seconds, even on grind setting 2 (Encores lowest is 0)

What I‚Äôve Tried:
	‚Ä¢	Grinding progressively finer (from setting 12 ‚Üí 2).
	‚Ä¢	Preheating machine and portafilter for 15+ minutes.
	‚Ä¢	WDT distribution + firm tamp.
	‚Ä¢	Targeting a 1:2 ratio in 25‚Äì30 seconds ‚Äî but can‚Äôt get anywhere close.

I would be happy to provide more information if needed! 

Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance!"

Buying a water softening system is out of the question.... so is my only course of action simply to buy plastic jugs of distilled water and spending even *more* money on adding something like third wave water? I'm sure it will still come out cheaper than our coffee shop trips, but man this whole process can get frustrating quick...

Or can I just descale my machine more often and hope for the best?

Would love some thoughts!

(Shot counter reads 66 - meaning it's pulled 660 shots!)

Pressure:

* With the cleaning disk in, the machine gets super loud to build initial pressure, does a quiet hum while keeping pressure, and then as soon as I stop pushing water through (nothing's coming out of the portafilter), I hear a PSHH and water releasing into the drip tray. 
* Sometimes, the portafilter twists left trying to release pressure while pushing water through
* But the pressure guage doesn't move at all! 
* Is just the pressure guage broken? How else could I verify the pressure is working fine on the machine?
* Don't have a grinder yet, but using the pressurized portafilter and some Cafe Bustelo espresso grounds, pulled a fine shot and made a latte!

Steaming Wand:

* With no wand tip, the pressure is moderate and very hot - can't hold my hand under it. The steaming wand also gets wayy too hot to touch. 
* But with steaming wand tip, the pressure isn't huge and I can hold my hand under it - it's not too hot.  
* Steaming milk this morning was about 30-45 seconds to get nicely textured milk. Is this normal? Too long? What would be normal?
* I've already tried putting the tip in cafeiza and making sure the holes aren't blocked in.  

I've heard a lot about the harms of potentially descaling this machine, esp the older 900XL. Is there a good way to flush out the boilers? I'm a bit worried there's some scale left in the steam boiler given what I mentioned above. Is it worth trying to descale? Could I just add slightly dilute cafeiza E31 tablets and run a ton of water through the steam wand or something?"

Basically when i extract I get coffee spewing from my portafilter which as many know is super annoying.

Now, I am somewhat experienced as i‚Äôve had my coffee set up for a couple of years now, but i recently moved back home where my family doesn‚Äôt quite see the value i place in coffee or my coffee set up. This is generally fine but i‚Äôve become frustrated because of one new problem I am having in relation to this seemingly unrelated information.

My espresso set up is a Gaggia Classic Pro, a timemore 064s grinder, and a bottomless normcore portafilter. I weigh in for 17.5-19 grams, distributor, level, tamp. etc.. Then i pull the shot and the shot struggles to come out, so naturally i adjust my grind to be coarser. when i do this, however, the espresso comes out way too fast, spewing everywhere. It seems like there‚Äôs hardly any room for error as i‚Äôm making micro adjustments when it comes to grind size.

Now, I haven‚Äôt had these problems in the past. BUT, in the past (i.e. before i moved back home) i bought my own coffee beans from either local roasters or coffee shops that i trust sell good quality beans. Present day, my family likes when i make them coffee so they buy beans‚Ä¶.. but these beans are usually from the grocery store, and they usually don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúroasted by‚Äù date, which for me is a big red flag.

Anyways, when i use these beans, my shot turns out possible, it makes a mess, and i can‚Äôt seem to really even dial it in.

Before any of you just say ‚Äúbuy your own beans‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ yes of course i can and simply will do that as i enjoy my beans more. what i‚Äôm asking or trying to understand is if the problem originated from the beans or maybe if there‚Äôs something bigger at play here.

I know this is long, and sort of complicated, but i appreciate any help."

Is there an origin/elevation/other combo I should focus on, when aiming for the flavour profile I described above? I'm looking for characteristics rather than brand suggestions because I live in Greece, so many US-specific brands will either not be available for purchase or be overly expensive due to logistics and/or taxes.

What electric grinders (either flat or conical burrs) would suit my needs for espresso? It would be ideal to have a bit more clarity than the K-Ultra for filter coffee as well.

Some of the options in my price range are:

* Femobook A68
* Lagom Casa
* DF64V/CF64V with SSP HU burrs
* DF83V with stock burrs"

I currently have a Breville Barista Express and planning to upgrade my machine next year (maybe Linea Micra but undecided) and getting a grinder first. I primarily do espresso (medium roasts usually) but occasionally pour over and french press which I would use the same grinder for. I don't frequently switch beans but try a new bag maybe every 2-3 months or so.

From what I've read the Atom is fast, quiet and more espresso specific which works for me. It would be my first choice but what I like better about the Libra is that it grinds by weight which feels like that should be a big plus. Its not espresso specific but from what I've read it does a good job for espresso as well. Otherwise, its slower and not as quiet as the Atom.

Anyone have any advice to help decide?"

I‚Äôve been drinking pour-over coffee daily for a while now, but I‚Äôm ready to upgrade to an espresso setup for more variety (especially milk-based drinks like lattes and flat wh
ites).

I‚Äôm currently deciding between two options and could really use some advice:


‚òïÔ∏è Option 1: Used Breville Barista Touch

1 year old, used every 2‚Äì3 days

$900 SGD

Built-in grinder, touchscreen interface, auto milk frothing

Well maintained (from what I can tell), but no remaining warranty


‚òïÔ∏è Option 2: New HiBREW H10A + HiBREW G5 Grinder

Brand new setup ‚Äî both items together at $360 SGD

More manual control, entry-level build quality

---

I‚Äôm torn between:

Paying more for long-term convenience, consistency, and better build (Breville), or

Spending less for a budget-friendly starter kit to explore espresso without a big upfront cost.


I do drink coffee every day and would likely use the machine 4‚Äì6 times a week. I can afford the Barista Touch, but I‚Äôm just unsure if it‚Äôs overkill or the smarter long-term investment.

Would love to hear your thoughts ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôve used either of these setups, or made a similar decision yourself.

Thanks in advance!

1,2025-07-27,Breville express grinder upgrade ?,u/Godzilla_vs_YoMama,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mb1fzi/breville_express_grinder_upgrade/,"Sorry for the ramble, but for context...



I bought a Breville Express machine around 2016(?), and used it for probably less than a year to make americanos mostly, sometimes cappuccinos. After a while I descaled the machine using vinegar according to the manual, but no matter how much I flushed it, I couldn't get rid of the vinegar smell/taste. I started doing pour overs, and have been doing that for the past 7 or 8 years, with the BBE sitting on my counter unused all that time. 



I finally decided to give it another go a couple weeks ago, and gave it a good cleaning (back flush) and descaling (with powder this time), and cleaned the grinder out thoroughly . Machine still works well, and no more vinegar smell. I pulled a few shots with the beans I had been using for pour overs, but it's far from fresh (no roast date, but likely 6 months or more ago), and had been opened for a few weeks. Shots were all sour. I figured it would be best to get some fresh beans before trying to dial anything in, so I got some darker beans locally, and pulled some shots, using the default portafilter and double shot single walled basket. Sour, went finer, sour, went a couple click finer, bitter, then went one courser and it wasn't perfect, but was a much better balance not terribly sour or bitter. That was grind setting of 3. I'd like to tweak further, but the difference between a single click on the built in grinder is night and day different, as far as the shot tastes. 



The coffee I bought had called for 20g in, 36g out, and while 20g did fit in the default basket, it was a tight fit, and left my screen messy, with the hole pattern imprinted in the puck after. I bought an IMS 18-22 basket, and a puck screen, and decided to give that a go. Everything is sour now :(. I've gone to the finest setting, tried increasing the ratio, and it's still sour to me. I assume the best to do would be to go even finer, but am unable to do so. Sooo, I've been looking at getting a better grinder... not crazy better, but was looking at the ESP or the DF54. Based on review and comparisons online, I think I've ruled out the DF54, even though it's arguably the better grinder. I primarily do darker roasts, sometimes medium, but I'll never do light, I don't like acidity at all, and much prefer the darker chocolate end of the spectrum, and the ESP seems better suited to that. 



Question is, will the ESP give me finer control at the lower end of the grind size, both in the ability to go finer, and the step size than the default Brevile grinder? NOTE that my brevile grinder has no internal burr adjustment, only the wheel on the outside. Maybe it can be shimmed? Would the ESP be a noticable upgrade? Once again, I do darker roasts, and usually americanos and milk drinks, very rarely a plain espresso, unless maybe I was able to dial it in absolutely perfect. 



any guidance appreciated. Thanks"

Only had to do a few minor repairs, but nothing unexpected for an espresso machine.

The La Cara I've owned since January and it has been a really fun machine to use and has unbelievable steam pressure. I use it when I have really early morning meetings and I don't want to risk waking the family.

I picked up the Macap tamper from a coffee shop that was closing during the pandemic for cheap and me (and my toddler) enjoy using it for consistent tamping.

Mahlonig x64sd - I love the look and it has been producing some great grounded coffee. My only complaints so far are that I really wish it didn't need the bellows as they sort of advertised, but it is wicked fast and quiet and I get exactly out exactly what I put it every time, and that using the bellows sprays a bit of coffee fines even past the catch cup extension.

I'm currently working on a 3d printed version of a QuinSpin, just need some time to finish the wiring. That will replace my knock box hopefully.

And on the topic of 3d printed, I also use a 3d printed portafilter holder and a umikot. Both have really been great additions along with a 3d printed lever attachment to the terrible steam knob on the Lelit.

The cabinet is a Wayfair POS (see tilting middle door), so that will need replacing soon, but inside is a red Faema Ciao that I restored along with a LaCimbali Microcimbali Liberty (in brass) that I also restored and constantly dealing with the corrosion of the boiler. Final one is a Pasquini Livietta (aka Olympia Maximatic) from the 80s that I got for free because the previous owner thought it didn't work, but he didn't realize you have to add water directly into the boiler in addition to the water reservoir.

I previously had a Nuova Simonelli Elli-matic that I got for $25 but gave that to my neighbor how got me into 3d printing.

I've develoepd a bad habit of searching for odd vintage machines and then can't help buying them when they're listed for $100 or lower."

[$50 CAD],u/brainsoft,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mb7csv/effective_funnel_for_breville_54mm_50_cad/,"I'm trying to conceptualize the perfect funnel for our breville 54mm portafilters, but I just can't seem to find the ultimate solution.  I'm definately overthinking this, but I just want to not make a mess on the counter or floor every day, or reduce how quickly the inevitable grinds build up at least.  Cleaning is always required of course, but I'd rather just not make the mess in the first place.

The problem is simple to define. Reduce stray coffee grinds to near zero.  This includes as much of the grinding and puck prep as possible.  I have a very confined prep space between the toaster and the Keurig where the grinder and Bambino Plus are squeezed in.  Spent pucks go into a compost bin on different counter beside the sink, so I'm already back and forth.  I grind and prep and brew at the coffee station, and knock and clean the portafilter at the sink after preparing the drink.  Not ideal, but I can't imagine that it is unique.

\-Perfect seal.  No ring of grounds on the top lip of the portafilter after removing the funnel.  Requires a curved profile and proper machining such the measurement from the bottom of the portafilter tabs to the top of the basket lip is accurate in the funnel retention clips/slots.  I returned one of the twist-on style and it was almost perfect, just 0.5mm additional machining and it would have been great.  The slight downward lip on the funnel otherwise perfectly matched  curve of the basket and it would have recessed perfectly into it.  If I pushed the backet out slight so it wasn't tightly seated I could closed the gap, but you have to re-set it every time, which is challaning with the stock portafilter.  Easier with a naked PF, but I'm really trying to reduce the cleaning burden so the naked PF is only for special occasions.

  
\-Frim grip.  I'm okay with strong magnets holding it on, but lots of comments complain about them falling off or the magents are not very strong.  And twist on style, most common complain is the clips break.  I have not tried one of them myself.  The Shardor grinder came with a little slip-in coffee filter but I think it is universal for 51 and 54 mm so it leave a very large ring around the outside and requires too much manual levelling after wdt.  


\-Operate direct to portafileter grinders, so it must push the button.  The nice magnetic or external retaining funnels are fundamentally incompatible, at least with my specific grinder, a Shordor (Amazon) direct to filter, convertable to dosing cup.  So for my case, since I am single dosing anyways, I could just use the cups setting and hold the portafilter instead of using the holder, but anyone with the built-in grinders can still have issues.

\-Dimensions.  Is the funnel tall enough to contain the grinders while doing you prep?  Is it also wide enough to catch everything that calls into it?  I don't mind taking the funnel off to tamp since I am using a collared spring tamper so I can't really use it with the funnel installed, but I think it would be nice to have the right combination of equipment that you could grind, distribute and tamp, all while containing any mess with the funnel.

\-Alternate distribution methods.  What if I want to shake instead of needle?  I thought I had it all figured out.  I grabbed a dosing cup, was going to just put my hand over it and shake shake and dump it in the basket.  But of course that's introducing another stray coffee issue.  But I can't see through the aluminum so I never know if I got it to land okay after flipping, or if my tapping and banging has gotten it to settle below the rim of the basket. So I don't know if I have a pile of grinds on one side, and still need to wdt just to even it back out.  Which means I'm back to needing a funnel or risking stray coffee.  The dosing cup has has reduced the outer ring that the Shardor funnel leaves behind to nearly nothing, but this has not simplified things the way I had hoped.  It was also too tall for that Shardor grinder so I had to remove the portafilter holder and single does in cups mode instead.

So, I thought maybe a shaker cup, like with the lid and plunger, drop it out the bottom.  But for what I'm seeing, I still need a funnel at that point as well if the height is important, otherwise it needs basket engagement sufficient to check off the initial perfect seal requirement, as well as the firm grip.  So what's that?  Stick a funnel on the bottom and a shaker on top?   The top half could actually be wider than the 54mm basket size, and funnel down to 54mm for the bottom half.  This would give the the funnel and the fitment needed at the basket, and the height above the basket that some say is important for pulling the plunger.  But this product does not exist either.

And so I've come back full circle.  If I could just find a simple funnel that had proper fitment, held on firmly and was large enough to prep, but ...

I'm overthinking this and going in circles.  I'm not just buying stuff, I'm trying to solve a problem, with a budget.  I'm at the start of my journey so I'm not concerned about something only being a a 2% improvement of the last thing. I'm just looking to buy it once and it works and I keep it.  If it doesn't work I'm sending it back, I don't need one of every toy or fad.  I'll even keep using my single prong paperclip style distributor that came with the grinder if I could just find a funnel that checked off the boxes.  I guess I could just keep buying and returning things to amazon, but I really hate wasting the time and resources that takes, especially when 9 out of 10 products are all the same chinese clone... probably, but you can't be sure what is close vs close enough vs just bad.  But does if product reviews don't mention the problems I had, does that mean that they don't have those problems, or that most people just don't care because it's already so much better than not using one at all?

[Budget 1k‚Ç¨],u/mereTz,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mb9lh6/help_me_out_with_grinders_budget_1k/,"So right now I'm rocking a DF64 gen 1 with SSP MP burrs paired with a Linea Micra. Working mostly with medium roast / omni-light (which isn't really that  light) roasts. 

I'm going through about 2.5kg of coffee per month - basically 4 coffees per day. Combination of espresso and milk based drinks. Maybe sometimes I'll grind for a cold brew.

I'm gonna get some bonus in about two months so I started researching a treat for myself üòÖ. Ideally I wouldn't want to get over 1k‚Ç¨, but I have the mazzer philos on my shortlist as a stretch - just because its so highly regarded.

 I want something that will last - same as with my Micra. I also want to maybe be able to experiment with different burrs and coffee properties.

My shortlist is:
- Varia VS6 (this started the whole upgraditis thing) with a couple of burrs to get to that 1k budget 
- Timemore 078s
- Mazzer Philos with the 200D burrs, though I'm not feeling it as much. The dial at the back seems clunky to use and it's big AF
- Mahlk√∂nig x64sd - though this seems a bit of a let down
- Df83v ( the horizontal one). Though I would stay away from the df grinder for now. 

I'm not really considering the niche just because...well I don't like it as much ü§∑ something bugs me about it. But if this subreddit can agree that it's that good, I'll take it. Functionality is key! 

Now one thing that confuses me. For most of these grinders, you have the ability to upgrade to ssp burrs. But isn't that just gonna give me the same-ish profile as my df64?

The other is, which one of these grinders is going to give me a sweeter profile? I like a decent amount of acidity, but I don't want it to be a dominating flavor. I like fruity coffees more. And I avoid anaerobic processing like it's the devil. I just can't extract it to have a nice feel in the cup üòÖ

I am interested in hearing about real experiences with the Comandante C60 Baracuda.

Currently I have a Comandante C40 MK4 and a Eureka Single Dose. My machine is a Profitec Go. I only drink espresso shots and never milk drinks. Most of the time I use medium-light to light roasts.

I much prefer the Comandante C40 over the Eureka Single Dose. The Eureka is getting no use at all.

For example, with my current beans, which are Gesha anaerobic natural from Peru, I do not get any subtle notes or brightness when I use the Eureka grinder. However, with the Comandante I discover a bright acidity and some delicious guava notes in the cup. With the Eureka there is always a dominant flavor that appears regardless of the beans I use. It seems like this is a constant note that comes from the grinder itself.

I want to upgrade, but not to an electric grinder, and I am only considering the C60.

I would really appreciate direct experiences from people who have used the C60 for espresso. Please avoid comments about price or alternatives. I am only looking for first-hand experiences.

Many thanks!

* DF83V
* Mazzer Philos

Can you recommend one of these grinders for both espresso and filter daily ? Or would you recommend a different setup?

Thanks to the post on this, i was brave enough to  recently installed a PID on my DeLonghi ECP and decided to test temperature stability by measuring water directly at the group head (removed the shower screen and inserted a thermometer into the dispersion hole)(see picture). Here‚Äôs what I found:  

1. **Warm-up Time & Stability**  
   - Even though the PID reaches its set temp quickly, the group itself takes over 5 minutes to stabilize.
   - Requires three 100ml flushes before temps settle.  
   - The best temp the group head achieved is 86 degree at 98 pid setting. 
   - To get 94¬∞C when the water come out from the group, I have to set the PID to 98¬∞C . Is this the same for everyone? Is it because of the small boiler? Or the temperature loose quicker without any build up pressure holding back the water flow?

2. **Comparison with Linea Mini**  
   - Tested a roomate warmed-up Linea Mini the same way (thermometer directly in the dispersion hole)  back to back.
   - The Mini‚Äôs group temp matched its app temp setting perfectly at 94, suggesting it has active heating around the group. When i turn on brew, water start at 94 then drop down slowly.
   - Also noticed the Mini‚Äôs PID overshoots by ~1.55¬∞C between shots, which was interesting.  

Thoughts
- The ECP‚Äôs group loses heat fast‚Äîmaybe adding thermal mass? Idk how
Anyone else modded their ECP and checked temps like this?  Is this the correct way to measure and achieve cafe quality shots?

Oh i use a single dose grinder with 64mm Ssp HU installed so grinder is not a problem
I use the high extraction basket that can take around 18-20G light roast. I found out that the coffee from linea mini is always more interesting, with sour flavour in it  at 1:2 ratio compate to the delonghi, same dose it produce a much balance and tea like flavour with 0 sour note, only floral note."

Where I live in the UK has VERY hard water so I've been using a water filter jug as it massively reduces visible limescale build up on my kettle heating element. I assumed it would also help improve my espresso, but I think there might be more to do yet! 

The La Marzocco water quality page lists 90-150ppm TDS as the ideal range for espresso water. Umm, I'm a little way above that still!

The two images attached are straight from the tap (395ppm) and from a Tesco Brita-compatible filter (304ppm).

The filter is definitely helpful in reducing mineral deposits on heating elements, but it looks like there's a lot more to do to help taste!"

[$300],u/kaltevuus,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mbojft/worth_restoring_an_80s_gaggia_owc_120_or_better/,"Back again! Last Saturday I purchased a 1989(?) Gaggia OWC for $10. The machine had one owner who had it stored the machine for a least a decade. She recently used it but then found that water no longer went through the intake despite the pump running. Looking online and asking people on here, I'm 90% sure that the solenoid is clogged since she didn't descale after taking it out of storage.

I reached out to a local espresso servicer and was quoted for $120 to fix/diagnose. I'm not intimidated by the price, especially since the machine is over 30 years old and hasn't been serviced before. Would probably be better than me brute forcing my way through fixing it haha (I have a nasty habit of breaking things). Externally the machine is pristine, and I'm a sucker for retro appliances/technology. 

But the big question is that would it be worth fixing? The price could go up depending on if they find anything else wrong or need to source new parts, I wouldn't be shocked if anything rubber related needs to be replaced. 

A new Gaggia Classic Pro is about $300 on Whole Latte Love currently; would it be smarter to purchase a new Gaggia instead of fixing the old one? I've been hearing mixed things about the Gaggia OWC, although it might depend on the year. Seems like the ones made in the 90s catch a lot of flak. Apparently there's also no 3-way solenoid, which means that the puck will be soggy after extraction. I don't think that would bug me, but I know people can be picky lol.

I currently have a De'Longhi Dedica so literally either of these options would be an upgrade haha. Thanks in advance! 

**TLDR; $120+ in fixing an 80s Gaggia OWC? Or just buy a new Gaggia Classic Pro for $300? Current machine is a De'Longhi Dedica.**

**Friday:** It worked great. My husband and I absolutely loved it.  
**Saturday:** The motor stopped working after about 5 seconds. I tried resetting the power (unplugged, held the reset button, plugged it back in), but it only spun briefly and then shut off again.

I contacted Prima Coffee, the *official* US distributor, and today I was told that a **refund** was the only option ‚Äî because it's now out of stock.

Frankly, the fact that I waited this long, paid **$590** for the grinder plus **$119** for a 2-year extended warranty, and ended up with a defective unit after **one use** is **incredibly upsetting**. This is not what I expected from such a reputable brand and distributor.

What really bothers me is that Prima Coffee doesn‚Äôt seem to take full responsibility ‚Äî maybe because they‚Äôre ‚Äújust the distributor‚Äù? But still, no other viable options were offered. No repair. No timeline for restock. Just refund.

I did nothing other than wipe everything down and fill it with water and let it warm up for 10 minutes. Using the included double basket, I did 18g in and got 38g out in 37 seconds hitting the double button. The gauge showed 12 bar through the extraction so I definitely will play around with grind settings but probably will end up opening the machine to see what I can do for an OPV mod.

My question is, would this machine be enough for a beginner to keep them with it longer term than some of the other machines? I know it‚Äôs a thermoblock, but they have come a long way in the last few years. Its design and function for the price (picked mine up for under $300 on AE) I don‚Äôt think can really be beat.

Final thought. The one thing that bugs me the most about the finish quality is the crappy plastic handle. Fortunately, it‚Äôs a standard M10 thread like all replacement handles so I threw a wood one on and it really adds to the aesthetic IMO. Gonna add a small matching one on the steam handle as well."

I also brew a V60 once a day. I have a Wilfa Uniform for the pour-overs, but for espresso I have a Rancilio Rocky. This was an ebay purchase about 12 years ago along with the Silvia. I've tried to find someone who will service the Rocky, but have got nowhere. I'd really rather be single dosing for my workflow, and the Rocky retains quite a lot.

So I'm looking at possible replacements. Everyone I've asked so far seems to think the DF64 would be a good upgrade. Do you agree? Obviously the Uniform is not really any use for espresso, although it does go fine enough I can't dial it in with any degree of accuracy."
8,2025-07-28,X64-SD,u/TheLeakestWink,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mbqihh/x64sd/,"I went out on a limb and bought the Mahlk√∂nig X64-SD in the hopes that it might turn out to be a sleeper deal, and on the strength of the company's reputation. So far I have not been impressed. 

Retention is much higher than the reported 0.1g even with aggressive bellows use, sometimes up to 0.6g. Granted, the burrs are not fully broken in, but it seems much of this is due to arrest/trapping of bean fragments (or even whole beans against the plastic separator column) on the metal infeed surface. RDT makes the problem even worse, but this surface is apparently susceptible to static cling, and the bellows don't entirely mitigate this. I have stopped doing RDT as a result.

Secondly, even before opening it up to check burr alignment etc., I noticed a concerning noise during initial operation (not grinding anything), best described as a ""rattle."" Even before checking the screws, I wondered if something was loose internally... This noise has persisted even after ensuring all screws were hand-tight.

Which brings me to the process of opening up the grind chamber and inspecting the burrs -- the machining is very unforgiving regarding alignment of the screws that secure the upper burr, and I partially stripped one screw head during the very first marker test. I ultimately abandoned further tests because of this problem, as I became concerned that this particular screw and perhaps others would become completely stripped.

Finally, I'm concerned that there may be significant zero point drift -- I zeroed the grinder initially, but found that I continued to have to re-zero with each marker test (only made it through 2.5) and after a fews days of light use, checked again and zero point had once again changed.

I have gotten a couple of decent shots, but frankly the true espresso range of the grinder is much more limited than their marketing would suggest (although this evaluation is complicated by the zero point issue).

I do like the silicone flapper, which does indeed reduce static, and does not appear to trap coffee (unfortunately that occurs elsewhere). The grounds cup is nice, although it too traps a significant amount of coffee, from 0.1-0.4g depending on residual static/clumping, and is so narrow and deep that it's not simple to brush them out without some transfer loss. Grinding directly into PF does not seem to be a good option given how aggressively the bellows must be used."

I‚Äôve watched a ton of review videos on various grinders and notice there‚Äôs a wide variance in how much mess lands outside of a dosing cup. 

It seems like most hand grinders have cups screwed or magnetically attached to the rest of the grinder which might reduce the mess of fines going everywhere. The Key grinder from Weber Workshops seems the ideal to me on the electric side because of the lid on the grinder and how the cup is attached, but that specific grinder is out of my price range. 

I currently have a Timemore Slim from ~2020 which works fine for me, but my concern is switching between filter and espresso would get a bit cumbersome as the grind adjustment is inside the grinder and requires either remembering what setting you‚Äôre currently at or zeroing out and counting each time you want to switch, so some external adjustment would be great, and also help keep fines inside the grinder until having time to clean.

I thought my grinder would be up to the task, but it failed horribly so I got a Kingrinder K6. Yes, this combo makes a delicious cup of coffee (I started making espresso for myself, but family asked for a lungo, honestly maybe the best lungo I've ever had).

Anyway, my shots were (very) inconsistent. Varying from 20-50 seconds using the same input parameters (coffee in, grind size, yield, puck prep etc). I bought a different WDT tool (I was basically just using a toothpick) which improved consistency a lot. I also found out that longer WDT equals very consistent shots. But it takes about 45-60 seconds of WDT. RDT also seemed to declump a little bit, so a bit less WDT was needed.

I guess I have a couple of questions:

1. Is that a normal amount of WDT? (it seems a bit excessive to me)
2. Is this grinder known for needing (a lot of) WDT?
3. Is there anything I could improve on so it doesn't need this kind of TLC?"

I‚Äôm relatively handy with electronics and repairs. I‚Äôm considering buying a used Lelit Bianca V3 (2 years old) being sold for $600. The seller says the machine ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt heat anymore‚Äù, but that everything else works fine. He suspects it‚Äôs just a temperature sensor issue.

Symptoms / Current Info:

* Machine powers on, but does not heat.
* All other functions are supposedly working (pump, display, switches).
* No leaking or strange noises reported.
* Seller believes it‚Äôs likely just the sensor, but it hasn‚Äôt been professionally inspected.

I‚Äôd appreciate help to identifying common failure points on the Lelit Bianca V3 that could cause a no-heat issue. How to test components (sensors, heating element, control board, fuses, etc.) or any suggested diagnostic procedures or checks I can run to isolate the problem.

Thanks for any guidance!"

I‚Äôm warming the head up by putting a few empty shots through before brewing. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any channelling. The weird thing is I can follow the exact same prep routine and the first shot comes out at around 35s (timed using a wacaco scale starting at first drip using the E setting) and the subsequent shot will come out at around 20s. At the start of each prep I brush the grinder and tap it to shift residue.

As I‚Äôm adding steamed milk they usually taste acceptable but occasionally I do want an espresso or to try an affogato but I can‚Äôt seem to keep consistency or hit a really sweet spot.

Got the nanofoamer lithium from subliminal for travel. It does a great job but it seems like the tip attachment doesn't last 20 cups before it breaks. 

Basically, the shaft that screws into the impeller tip eventually pushes through, tossing black plastic fragments into the beverage. It's impossible anything could have impacted it, since it's kept in the case and the part that breaks is at the center, while the fins and screen are just fine.

Only thing that makes sense to me is the resistance of the liquid is too much for how the shaft connects to the impeller at the end. I'm just frothing whole milk heated in a microwave, nothing it wasn't designed to do.

It seems like a design issue to me but I wondered if I just got a defective one. Anyone else had the same experience?"

Using a similar dose and prep on the Bambino leads to an extraction that creates multiple streams that never coalesce into one, and there are some bald spots on the portafilter mid-extraction. The taste comes out really muddy and unclear. I imagine puck prep is an issue here, but maybe it's grind too? If anyone has used both, do you generally have to grind finer or coarser when switching from the Picopresso to Bambino?

I think the Pico uses a 52mm portafilter and the Bambino uses a 54mm portafilter, so maybe I just need general advice when it comes to increasing basket size."

Outcome tastes a bit over extracted, the shot time ran longer than expected, probably due to the lower pressure, but not bad for a first attempt.

Even with a new gasket on the brew group, I hate that when dialing in I get some blowouts from the brew group; I guess that the portafilter fit cannot handle the pressure.

Also, specially with the current roast which was pretty much beans to cup, I left it pretty light, and hand grinding has become a chore, so I want an espresso capable grinder to take some of the effort from making coffee, and a machine that can give me a decent shot. I have an older Breville model that has been running for over 7 years, but was never meant to be used with unpressurized baskets.

Things that I want from the grinder, stepless adjustment, sub 200 USD, and likelihood of working over a couple of years without giving out.

Things that I want from the machine, 9 bar opv, and mostly constructed well. I think that the Gaggia from the three I mentioned is built like a tank, but lacks some temp stability, and I am not sure if the OPV is set at 9, but that seems like something I could easily achieve. on the other hand the H10B has some temp control, but It looks and feels cheap even on video if that makes sense, but the price is so low that if it gives me a year, I would not be disappointed, and last the Turin which comes with all the things I may want on a brewer right now, but I would be surprised if it works for 5 years of daily use.

I am mainly on this predicament because I was watching some videos of how to install a PID on a Gaggia, and it was a bit intimidating.

Thanks in advance for your time and recommendations.

The 200 limit on the grinder is mostly due to taxes, as I would have to pay around 35 percent on anything over that price. I am willing to do so on the machine because the machines under that price are extremely basic or low quality like the H10B while on the grinders side, the SK40 at the least looks like it can take a beating. Also, I like that the conical burrs are less finicky, but again, I have never tried anything ground by a flat burr grinder so who knows."

First couple espressos we made here were really noticeably much better; the taste improvement was super apparent even in milk drinks. Awesome.

However, on only like our third use here, it started clumping on steroids; like dropping logs (see picture). Then it just stopped working altogether (maybe a log got stuck in the shoot and overheated the motor? I hate it when logs get stuck in the shoot...).   
  
There's nothing wrong with the beans, they're not wet or anything...certainly nothing wrong enough with the beans to give an old breville built-in grinder any problems...which is what we've gone back to using here at my dad's place, with the same beans the Varia died on after three grinds.

They responded saying that the Yu series uses an impact spring to assist in tamping, however a lot of the work was done by the force of the user pushing the tamper. While the Knignt impact tamper pretty much only uses the force of the impact generated by the spring when actuated. They said that this translates to a less manual feel, a lighter actuation, less effort by the user, and more consistency due to less user input. This intrigued me as it sounded like this tamper was more similar to the force tamper that has been popular for a while now. 

As someone who was really interested in the force tamper but refused to spend 200 dollars on such a tool, I decided to pull the trigger and have this be my new tamper. I have seen zero reviews on this thing no one has really mentioned it, and there are not videos online except from the company itself. It also isn‚Äôt even on Amazon yet so I have decided to put a little review here for anyone who is thinking about getting one. 

The tamper arrives in a box with just itself and a little rubber stand for it to sit in when not in use. It seems very well made, there are no manufacturing issues and the build is sturdy. In use, the impact mechanism is easy to actuate and does a really good job compressing the coffee grounds. The impact is actually pretty intense, when I first received the tamper I pressed it into my hand and was shocked at how hard it hit back at me. It‚Äôs not overly loud but does have a good bang to it. 

I am not a huge fan of the ripple base, but it also hasn‚Äôt caused me any real issues. Grounds don‚Äôt really seem to stick to it much, but I really don‚Äôt see the point of it except just to look cool. One issue people talk about with the force tamper is that because of the impact, grounds find its way between the leveling collar and the tamping plate. This is an issue with this tamper as well, after a few uses there are a considerable amount of grounds that get trapped in here. You can‚Äôt see them unless you pull the collar back. It‚Äôs really easy to clean however because of how easy it is to pull that leveling collar back, you can just blow them away or brush them and it‚Äôs good as new. 

My wife loves this tamper. It‚Äôs impossible to tamp uneven and the light actuation of the impact spring means she doesn‚Äôt have to try very hard to compress the grounds. 

The looks of the tamper are kind of hit or miss. I think the tamper looks really good, and its ergonomically comfortable. The logo on top I think is a nice touch but I would prefer it to just be embossed and kept black. However I hate the white lettering around the leveling collar of the tamper. I don‚Äôt know why MHW insist on putting letters, branding, and words all over their accessories. ‚ÄúSince 2019‚Äù is not very impressive as far as company history so I‚Äôm unsure why they feel the need to print this on the product, along with everything else. Some of their newer products I feel like they are starting to get the design and branding down, but they are obviously still struggling in that department. 

I really like the products from this company so far, I have a couple accessories from them and they are seemingly well made and useful. 

Overall I am very happy with the purchase. It has eased my desire to purchase some overpriced tamper just for the gimmick of an ‚Äúimpact‚Äù. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs just a way to squish coffee into a smaller area in order to brew it, most every tamper will offer the same result but I do find this one to be pretty cool.

Based on what I found they look to be good to me, but this is also the only time I've ever done this, so I'm genuinely open to opinions here.

One things that I was a little surprised by was the amount of fines that were already building up inside of the grinder after using it only for only 4 days. I'm realistic to not expect a grinder to be spotless inside by any means, but this build up seems like a lot for such a short period, especially since it seems like it will just collect deeper into the body. Any thoughts or am I being overly anal?

Regarding the disassembly, this was actually very easy to do. I was extra cautious after hearing some people have stripped a screw already, but I just made sure to have a screwdriver with a head that fit fully into the slots. I did notice that replacing the screws for the upper burr carrier was a little tricky because they can get cross threaded and obviously become difficult to tighten. I figured out that if I spin the screw counter clockwise first until I feel the click of the thread openings passing each other and then at that point tightening that it worked every time.

In terms of my satisfaction with the grinder, I am slightly disappointed that the retention is not what was advertised without bellows, but maybe this is because it just needs more coffee to run through it. With the bellows, which are far quieter than doing so on my Eureka, I get <0.1g almost every single time.

so i had my first 10 days with the Sage Barista and it was frustrating. I can't understand what part of the process i'm doing wrong.

I'm using this coffee

[Coffee Explorer Pack](https://magistralecyclingcoffee.cc/coffee/coffee-explorer-pack/)

Let's take this in particulare

**Leeuw van Vlaanderen - Brazil**

*Barista info (Double shot)*  
***Dose (IN):***¬†*18,5 grams*  
***Extraction Time:***¬†*29 sec*  
***Shot Weight (OUT):***¬†*40¬†grams*

So what i do is i weight the coffee, grind the beans (at the moment the outer grind wheel is set on 4, inner is also 4 and not 6 as factory settings) until the hopper is empty.

Then i press the coffee and until this part,it seems ok. Not too much coffee,even surface etc.

Then i do a flush without the portafilter.

Now the problems begins: using the automatic mode, the extracting time is too random (but usually shorter than indicated).

Im trying to make an upgrade in my timemore chestnut c3, i just cannot stand manual grinding anymore. I drink cappucino/lattes.

I made some research and ESP and DF54 seems like good choice, with some pros to DF54, however.

I live in Poland, and in my local currency i can buy ESP for \~190$, and DF54 for \~325$ - which seems to be overpriced.

And i know DF54 seems to be better, but is it that much better, so its worth to pay about 130bucks more for it?

First time poster and visitor to this sub.

For the longest time i was eyeing a Dedica as my first device up until after countless of hours of Youtube ( more specifically James Hoffman) a device appeared which grabbed my attention.

It was the ROK espresso GC, i liked its simplicity, ease of use and size and more importantly its price, i can afford much higher end but since i know myself from other hobbies i set myself a budget this time.

After reading and watching some more on it, the commercial version of the ROK with the gauge was the set i was dialing in ( due to the competition ""shower head"" and more importantly a gauge to see how i was doing).

My question is if the ROK website offers deals and if so at around which period?

- Eureka mignon silenzio electric grinder

BUT... I've started to get the itch for an upgrade again. What would people recommend as a step up? I am not looking at spending 5k, but would allow a decent upgrade.

Also, I originally got the bambino for space reasons. Something not too large would be best for a machine upgrade.

I do not drink espresso every day so I guess best option is to single dose. 

I recently got a Mythos 1 as part of a deal, and I have been reading on single dosing, retention etc. 

Per design, the retention is ‚Äúlow‚Äù, but still too high (would need flushing 6-8 grams through each time, which I want to avoid). 

Am I correct that 1) removing clump crusher 2) humidifying beans before grind to avoid static 3) using some sort of air bellow to push beans and ground coffee down and out, would make this a suitable single dose grinder?
I read that this could get retention close to zero. 

Unless going Monolith (no, to expensive) this seem like a pretty solid option (and the grinder I got ‚Äúfor free‚Äù), would you agree?

There is an off-the-shelf single dose hopper available (see pic). 
I also saw a guy who DIY‚Äôed it, cutting down the case and dosing directly into the grind chamber.

While everything looked mostly good, I noticed one of the silicone tubes (circled in red in the photo) was slightly degraded ‚Äî sticky to the touch and appears to be melting onto what I believe is the steam boiler.

Also, any tips to prevent this from happening again? From what I can tell, the tube may have softened over time and sagged onto the hot boiler, or perhaps it was routed that way from the factory.

Long-time lurker, first-time ""buy once, cry once"" buyer here. I'm about to pull the trigger on what I hope will be my lifetime espresso setup and would love some sanity checks from the community.

**Current situation:**

* Nespresso Vertuo user (for convenience due to previous lifestyle up to now travelling 80% of the year internationally) looking to upgrade to ""real"" espresso (due to recent life changes and remote working at home)
* Based in Spain (Madrid)
* Appreciate good ristrettos, espressos and lattes
* Prioritizing long-term quality and aesthetics over budget (without making me buy the Weber EG1 and Lamarzocco please)
* 4 coffee drinks daily, half of them milk-based

**The planned setup:**

* **Machine**: Lelit Bianca V3 (Around ‚Ç¨2,400 regular). I saw the Elizabeth but Bianca is a lot sexier!
* **Grinder**: DF83 V3 with SSP HU burrs pre-installed (‚Ç¨1,200-1,400)
* **Total**: \~‚Ç¨3,600-3,800 depending on deals

**Why these choices:**

* Love the Bianca's aesthetics and the flow control paddle seems perfect for experimentation
* DF83 + SSP HU should be endgame-level grinding without needing future upgrades
* Want to avoid the ""upgrade spiral"" - buy once, use for 10+ years

**My specific questions:**

1. Am I crazy to go straight from Nespresso to this level, or is it actually smarter to skip the intermediate steps?
2. Any Spaniards here with experience buying DF83 from European retailers vs local options?
3. Is the SSP HU upgrade worth it from day one, or should I start with stock burrs?
4. Anyone regret going with the Bianca over Elizabeth/other dual boilers?

I understand the learning curve will be steep but I'm excited about it

This represents a pretty big investment for me, so any real-world experiences, alternative suggestions, or ""wish I'd known"" advice would be hugely appreciated!

I still have not done a thorough research on other tools & accessories needed, which I will not underestimate as they will also represent a big chunk of money.

**TL;DR**: Jumping from Nespresso to Bianca V3 + DF83 SSP - smart lifetime buy or overcomplicating things?"

I have a slight issue with my Breville Dual Boiler. I have had it for a few years now and it has always worked perfectly. But recently, when i make an espresso with it, the pressure indicated on the pressure gauge never goes past 1 or 2 bars.

I suspected my coffee grind was too coarse, so I changed my grinder settings to be finer. But this did not solve the issue. I then suspected that my coffee beans may be stale, so i bought fresh coffee from a different brand, but this did not solve the issue either.

I also did a few backflushes, during which the pressure went between constantly 7 and 9 bars. This means that the machine can generate that pressure during backflushes but not during brewing, which seems a bit weird to me, as the machine has always performed correctly.

Any idea of what the issue and solution to this might be?

It has been pretty solid so far. I have a blade grinder, sometimes get pre-ground coffee from roasters and grocery shops. Everything was alright for a while. Not my French press broke, V60 has cracks and I am running primarily on aeropress. I am planning to get a true espresso machine, but it feels too much overall - both the cost and the learning curve. 80% of the times I drink black coffee, but 20% I might make milk drinks. Today I heat some milk in microwave and use my frother to get it frothy and add it to my Aeropress espresso, maybe once or twice a week.

Current products considering:

* DELONGHI Stilosa EC260BK
* Hibrew H11 
* Host of other chinese espresso machines in Ali Express / Temu
* Wacaco portable espresso machine (or a¬†Chinese knockoffs from amazon, Ali Express)
* Moka pot - seems like aeropress, not true espresso. Considering it as a fallback option

But I am struggling with latte art. The milk is always to foamy and not silky enough for latte art. I'm using soy milk, so that may be the problem too.  
I think too much air is being added, but not sure how to fix this. I've tried stretching the milk for only about a second before lowering the wand further but there are still too many bubbles and the milk doesn't texture properly and create the vortex that I've seen in other videos. I've tried both the hot milk and cappuccino settings.  
The Delonghi Linea classic does seem to have a smaller, but wider wand than any other espresso machine, so maybe that's part of the problem too? "

0,2025-07-30,Looking to purchase my first legit espresso setup! [under $2000],u/Voicka,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mda49g/looking_to_purchase_my_first_legit_espresso_setup/,"**Hello everyone!**

I'm a coffee enthusiast looking to purchase my first *legit* espresso machine, and I‚Äôd love some advice from this amazing community.

# Current Setup & Background

I‚Äôve been brewing filter coffee for a while now using a **Fellow Ode Gen 2** paired with a **Hario Switch**, and I‚Äôve really enjoyed experimenting with beans from my **Sey Coffee subscription**.

That said, I‚Äôve recently developed a growing interest in espresso and would like to step into this world properly. I do have some very light experience from using a **Breville Barista Express** years ago, but nothing beyond that.

Currently, I also have an **Illy pod machine**, which I plan to keep for quick morning runs‚Äîespecially since I‚Äôve got a **newborn baby** and mornings can get hectic. But for all other times, I want a setup that gives me both quality and room to grow.

# Priorities

Given my current lifestyle as a **busy working dad**, I'm looking for:

* A machine that offers some *assistance* and *time-efficiency* for now
* But also has enough potential for me to **experiment and grow** into the hobby as time allows

# Grinder Selection

I'm leaning toward the **DF64 Gen 2.5** ‚Äî it seems to offer excellent value, especially compared to the **Niche Zero**, which was originally my top choice but feels less justifiable in terms of price.

Do you have any other recommendations in the same general price range that I should consider?

# Espresso Machine Shortlist

Here are the machines I‚Äôve been eyeing:

1. **Fellow Espresso Series 1**
   * Brand new, but very appealing to me.
   * Fast startup, assisted features, and modern design.
   * Seems ideal for someone like me who's balancing time and interest.
2. **El Rocio Manus S**
   * Looks beautiful and capable, but seems more manual and learning-heavy.
   * I'm definitely open to learning, but unsure if it's the best match *right now* given my situation.
3. **Turin Legato V2**
   * Solid reputation for its price.
   * Seems to pack a lot of pro features without breaking the bank.
4. **Meraki Ultimate All-in-One**
   * Comes with a built-in grinder, which could simplify my purchase.
   * Has a lot of convenience features and automation like the Fellow, but I'm unsure about its build and long-term reliability.

# Roast Recommendations?

While I love my **Sey light roasts** for filter coffee, I‚Äôd also like to try **medium to dark roasts** for espresso‚Äîespecially for milk drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.

Any good roasters you‚Äôd recommend for that flavor profile?

**Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated‚Äîespecially from anyone who‚Äôs used any of the machines above, or been in a similar situation!**  
Thanks in advance üôè"

I'm doing 18g in 36g out at 29 to 33 seconds. I'm also trying to move away from sugar in my espresso. So the flavor is unfamiliar to me.

Do people ever go to other people's houses and help them dial in? Or maybe take their beans to someone so they can see what they should taste like?

let me start with this‚Ä¶. Aesthetics matter to me a lot lol. So right now i have a rancilio silvia with pid and a dimmer mod.

But i hear a lot of bad things about heat exchanger and the temp fluctuating. But Just because i make milk based drinks doesnt mean i wanna make bad espresso. All im trying to say is do you think the rocket would be good enough for me. I just want a decent cappuccino and be able to make me and my wife drink back to back. 
Will I notice a bad difference in taste by getting the rocket over my current machine?"

However, it seems that no matter if I grind finer or unfiner my espresso is splashing everywhere and that's quite frustrating.

I assume it's due to uneven extraction - I have three theories what could be wrong:

1. I don't use a WDT tool and rely on shaking and tapping on the portafilter - solution: buy a WDT tool.
2. I use an unbranded bottomless basket that might have uneven holes and the fines get stuck during extraction causing the splashing - solution: buy a precise basket
3. The tamper I use has a light spring and does not allow enough pressure - solution: buy a different tamper.

Huge waste of time and pain in the ass but it makes a very tasty dessert.

I'm thinking about testing cold brew concentrate as a replacement for the espresso in the recipe, I know we need to grind very coarse but does anyone have experience with cold brew for tiramisu specifically? It needs to cut through all of the other ingredients so it has to be strong, what kind of ratio should I try then?

I read that cold brew concentrate is usually around 1:8 coffee to water or more. Would it be a good idea to go lower like 1:4 since it's not going to be a drink?

Also, can you start the recipe with hot water, Would it make a stronger cold brew?"

Sculptor 064S - Screeching noise at the end of grinding after cleaning

Post Body:

Hey everyone,
I recently disassembled and cleaned my Timemore Sculptor 064S for regular maintenance. After putting everything back together and making sure the burrs were aligned and properly tightened, I noticed a screeching (high-pitched) noise that happens only near the end of grinding ‚Äì specifically when the beans are almost gone.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve observed:
	‚Ä¢	The grinder runs smoothly at the beginning.
	‚Ä¢	The screech happens only in the last few seconds of the grind.
	‚Ä¢	If I grind a larger dose, the noise is delayed but still appears near the end.
	‚Ä¢	It didn‚Äôt make this noise before I cleaned it.
	‚Ä¢	I tried running it empty, adjusting the grind size, and cleaning again with a brush and bellows ‚Äî but the noise still comes back.

Any ideas what might be causing this? Could the burrs be too close or something stuck between them?
Appreciate any help or similar experiences"

- When I pull a shot using an empty pressurized portafilter basket, a 30 second extraction time gives me about 4 oz. / 120ml of water. Does that indicate my pressurized basket is not pressurized enough and is letting too much liquid through?

- Said differently: If I understand how pressurized portafilters work, I would expect them to be regulated to provide 1 oz. / 30ml of liquid, regardless of how coarse the grind is (or even when the basket is totally empty). What is the point of a pressurized basket, that is not pressurized enough to approximate the pressure and time of a ‚Äògood‚Äô grind ?

For specifics, I am using a Cuisinart EM-100, and that 120ml ‚Äòblank‚Äô pull happens with all three of my pressurized portafilters: The single, the double, and ESE pod holder. I am using the pressurized filters because I don‚Äôt have a consistently good grinder. The 30 seconds is measured from the time I turn the pump.

Another example: If I use an ESE pod (which I assume is a decent/serviceable grind), I -*do*- get a ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô extraction: approx. 30ml after 30 seconds, measuring the moment I turn on the pump. This seems to tell me my machine has the proper amount of pressure when I use coffee that is properly ground. Yet without an ESE coffee pod and the portafilter empty, 30 seconds gives me about four times that amount of liquid as mentioned.

Obviously my coffee will not be perfect using the pressurized filters and supermarket ground coffee - I‚Äôm fine with that for now, my machine isn‚Äôt ideal anyway. But I do want to make sure my portafilters aren‚Äôt somehow defective, or that I‚Äôm using them properly in the meantime."

Pros:
It's beautiful and compact

Machine heats up quickly. The boiler is ready maybe in 2..4 minutes, and the portafilter is hot in ~10..15 mins. Before buying the machine I thought that fast heat up time would be a deal breaker for me, but in reality it's much less important. If it would be 25 minutes, I would still be satisfied 

Design is quite robust. I don't feel any particularly weak parts. And actually I haven't had any problems so far with any of the parts

I achieve consistent coffee

Steaming is fast, maybe even too fast, it takes around ~10 seconds to heat ~200ml of milk

And the pressure regulator works well too. I often use it to create pre infusion. I've no idea if it does anything to coffee though 


CONs:
The basin for the water collection sometimes connects to the machine in a way, that they vibrate and create too much noise

If you had a flexible budget of $700 and were looking for a grinder that can produce an espresso with a defined body and noticeable flavour separation what would you purchase?

I have been stuck trying to decide for like a month now.

I've been a long time pour-over drinker with a dedicated grinder (Ode gen 2) and love my high clarity brews, but really want to experience some nice texture in my espressos rather than extremely clear/thin flavours 

Bonus points if the grinder can swap out burrs that let me go more clear in the future if I decide I want that, I'm assuming there are SSPs for this.

I already have a few models in mind, but would love to hear peoples suggestions without any of my input

I was doing some ‚Äúuh oh, I actually need to figure out what to do with all this coffee‚Ä¶‚Äù and found a video on YouTube recommending throwing the whole bag in the freezer and dosing right out of the freezer. What the heck, I thought, and taped the valves, put all the bags in the freezer.

Here were are 4.25 months later and the last bag is pulling like it‚Äôs fresh! This last bag is their Westside espresso, a slightly darker than medium espresso blend. It tastes awesome, pulls like a dream. The other 4 coffees I bought were all light roasts and all did fantastic as well. Once dialed in, the shots are completely consistent every pull from day to day and if there was any fall off in flavor over the 4 months I sure can‚Äôt tell.

I only wish I had known about this during the years I had my coffee review site and at any given time had 20 bags of coffee I was quickly working through before they would fall off. Freezer would have made life a lot easier! LOL

People are very concerned about condensation, this has not been a problem. I leave the bag in the freezer and dose right out of the freezer without removing the bag. No issues with the grinder. Absolutely zero downsides that I have found running almost 8 pounds this way over what will end up being the better part of 5 months of freezing.  "

First day with it went through a bag of beans (all were fresh locally roasted) and were getting shots all over the place with no consistency. Went through Ninja and they determined it was a machine fault and they sent me a replacement. 

New machine I got dialed in after a few shots and managed to make a couple cups of great espresso. 

Later that same day I went to brew another with the same configuration and everything and the shot was awful. I went through another bag of beans trying to dial in and once again had horrible shots of espresso. 

The Luxe has the barista assist that i know you should go off of (which i didn't with the continuous trouble shooting), but I feel like if thats a main feature of the machine and its so inconsistent then why spend the money for it.

At this point I am going to return the machine. Im not sure if its a Ninja Luxe thing or an overrated espresso thing, but I don't want to have to trouble shoot everytime I want a cup of coffee. Lol 
I get needing to dial in and thats a process, but once its dialed in id expect to still be the same day with same settings, beans ect.


With that being said does anyone have any suggestions for a beginner friendly, consistent espresso machine? Or would my experience be the standard in the world of espresso making and I should save my money and just stick to regular coffee at home? Lol"

I really need some help dialing in shots with my Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista (I know it‚Äôs a bad machine but I‚Äôm budget restricted). Before we get started, I ditched the pressurized portafilter that comes with the machine for a bottomless one. I am using a Fellow Opus grinder, a distributor, WDT tool, calibrated tamper, a metal puck screen on top of the puck and filter paper on the bottom of the puck (placed in the basket before the grounds. I heard this can mellow out some of the harsh flavors which, as you‚Äôll see below, I desperately need). I am also dosing 18g of a light/ blonde roast.

The issue I‚Äôm running into is that no matter how fine or coarse I grind, my shots are coming out very bitter/ sour and acidic. When I grind fine (around a 3.5 on my grinder), the shot barely comes through the portafilter and tastes how I described above. That shot took about 40 seconds to get to a 36g yield. When I grind coarser (around a 4.5), it comes through in around 20-24 seconds and tastes the same as before. I‚Äôve gone through an entire 12oz bag of beans at this point. I‚Äôve heard that light roasts are inherently more difficult to extract properly. I‚Äôm currently trying to stick to the 1:2 - 1:2.5 ratio within 20-30 seconds. I heard that light roasts require longer ratios and shot times to extract properly. Is this true?

I‚Äôve locked in the dose and yield so the only variable I can think to change would be grind size, but the shots taste horrible no matter what size I grind. If what I‚Äôve recently read is true and I need to aim for a longer ratios (1:3 or more) and/ or longer pre infusion, I‚Äôll try that but I hate to waste another bag of beans just to keep getting the same result.

I appreciate any help!"

I can't find any information online about this specific problem besides the basics of ""how to clean your steam wand"". I use the provided needle tool to clean the holes after every cup and wipe it down completely so no milk is left on it.

I was hoping to get input from someone who has experience brewing light roasts and/or Gesha for espresso. I usually don't go for rare types of specialty coffee but out of curiosity, I purchased a Gesha, roasted for espresso from AMOC [https://amatterofconcrete.com/product/052/](https://amatterofconcrete.com/product/052/) .  
I don't have much experience with the variety, but my few run-ins with it were not good and I just ignored it as it's either over-hyped and expensive, usually aimed for filter.  
I found it weird that it's not a filter roast, which I usually get for my standard roasts, even if I only brew espresso out of those, since most roasters just roast darker and call it espresso.

Now my problem with this one is that it's 12 days off roast, the beans look kinda lower end of medium, but I can't pull anything out of these. They are incredibly brittle and easy to break by finger and have no visible adhesion on the bottomless, pull looks like half year old supermarket coffee would produce.  
My shots resulted in watery and tasteless liquids no matter if I tried gushers (1 : 3) or chokers (1 : 1.5-2).  
I realize it's not easy to convey the issues in writing, but based on the variety, process and the roast level, I was hoping someone can give some pointers.  
Maybe these are much older than the packaging claims, with little to no CO2 left in them?  
Or should I just wait and age the coffee more ?"

Bonus feature that it has dual boiler so I can steam milk at the same time (not deal breaker if it doesn't since I have a Flair Wizard steamer on the side). 

I've been considering the Meraki espresso machine that has all of the things I'm looking for and the prices tag seems too good to be true. I've seen some really horrible stories regarding this machine and the relatively new company behind it so I think I'll skip this one.

The Odyssey Argos lever machine is somewhat semi-automatic (pull down and let it go while you steam milk) which I am considering as well but they are in backorder and probably wont ship the machine until a few months.

There's also the Ninja all in one machine that cost around $700 but I don't like the integrated grind/stamp it has (not a dealbreaker for me since I have my own grinder) and the automatic brew seems decent but not reliable since it brews by trying to detect the water passthrough instead of the weight output so skipping this one.

Not sure if breville offers something like this.

My use case is the following:

\* I will start easy (as I have to learn to grind and dial|) but want to move eventually towards medium or lighter roasts. I don‚Äôt quite know if I will ever get to try lighter roast, and maybe my being Italian will keep me towards dark or medium roasts.

I live in France (Paris) and I would like to buy an espresso machine. I hesitate between the Sage Barista Express and the Flair Pro 2. I know it's not really the same type of machine, but let me explain.

For the moment I got a V60 and a basic grinder (the Bistro from Bodum) and I would like to have an espresso machine to do 1 or 2 coffee per day. I'm not really intrested in the latte or americano universe, I just need the best espresso I could get for 500 ‚Ç¨. Small disclamer, my wife would not be against latte, but not the priority.

I really want to explore and go more deep in the espresso hobbit. And after some research I found the Flair Pro 2 that seems great to pull good espresso and the Sage Barista Express which seems a great machine when you want to start. But right now I really don't know which one to choose. On one side I don't have a lot of tools right now so the Flair Pro 2 is maybe not the best. But on the other side is the Sage as professionnal (for espresso I mean) as the Flair.

So here my hesitation and I will take any advice.

A great thanks (and sorry for my english)

I own an Expobar Office Lever (single boiler model). I think I bought it in 2017-2019, some time like that. It served me pretty well with some part replacements (pressurestat, boiler valve...).

Well, now I have encountered something I have not seen before. It starts out just fine. Pumps some water into the boiler, starts heating. Then it either stops heating when water starts to boil or just shortly past that after the boiler valve closes. Initially I thought it's again a failty pressurestat. I had two at home but changing neither of these two seems to remedy the problem. I can't be however sure that these pressurestats are not faulty as I had them at home and I can't recall why I had these (maybe they were not so great in the first place). I don't think this is a wiring problem (I.e. loose wires). Just in case though, I cleaned all connections with a wire brush.

I ordered a new pressurestat. I am also going to change/upgrade the boiler valve as the one I have now has been cleaned and rebuilt a few times. This is not the issue.

My understanding is that were this a faulty heating element, it would not heat at all, correct?

My deep fear is that there is something wrong with the water level board (the central board). I don't know why I think that. What would be some signs/symptoms of a faulty central board?

Just out of curiosity, I tapped a few times on the pressurestat (bot of them) and there was light ""blip"" signaling that the heater is on. But this is also inconsistent.

Any advice?"

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Dial in : i‚Äôve only used 18g in 36g out, in about 30 seconds. ~165 f¬∞ (absolute highest the machine brews for some reason). i‚Äôve grinded finer and finer (and coarser). my ‚Äúperfect‚Äù shots of 36g out at 30 seconds have all tasted weak and underdeveloped, but most crucially completely lose their flavor and any complexity in more than 2oz of milk.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Beans : i‚Äôve tried so many different beans here in the LA/OC area, i wanna say at least 7 different roasters at this point. all fresh, I use them beginning a week after roast date. most of them have been medium-dark, with a few mediums. all yielded the same results of an empty tasting shot.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Puck Prep : WDT from SworksDesign (love), tamping with the built-in one, shower screen, bottomless portafilter never shows channeling.

I also warm up the machine for 20 minutes before each shot, backflush maybe once a week, and descale once every 6 months or so.

Im running on 6 inner burr setting, I went up to 7 and had the same issue so I just went back to the default

It will grind for the first few seconds, then the clutch initiates (jams) and then it stops and grinds some more, then it does it again and will continue to do so until the beans are fully ground.  Any reason why?  When I pull the shot it comes out too fast so I need to grind finer, but if I grind finer the intermittent jamming happens.

But not so lazy I‚Äôm willing to give over to a super; not even a good one. I would prefer a PID temp system and probably some programmable pre-infusion and shot timing.

Enough that I‚Äôm willing to pretend I enjoy watching and controlling the pull, with no *need* for the technical precision of scales or external, multiple timers. 

From a quick browse, the Lelit Bianca ($3k) seems to fit, though I can‚Äôt tell if it can take supply plumbing. Im also a bit concerned about their purchase by Breville.
